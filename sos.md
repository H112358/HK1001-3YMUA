## Unicellular to multicellular life
• <mark>Examples of signalling molecules released by bacteria and their effects on individual cells and populations</mark>
• Quorum sensing as a method of communication between bacteria within a population
1. Example quorum sensing molecules: AHL (N-acylhomoseine lactose) in G- bacteria e.g. Principles of Neurobiologyibrio *fisheri*  as a <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">cell population density</span> signal, in *fisheri* this signal binds to lux(R/l?) and forms an active transcription factor that activates transcription of lux(R/l?) that induces <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">bioilluminescense</span>, such is an example of quorum sensing by autoinduction
• <mark>Regulatory</mark> and physiological adaptations to stress in bacteria
1. Sporulation occurs in bacteria in response to stressful conditions, upon division, such bacteria produces a dormant cell that does not follow its own <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">vegetative</span> growth lifestyle. the first steps - formation of a septum between two divided sets of chromosomes - is similar to binary fission, but the mother cell then engulfs this daughter cell, which then loses most of its water content and envelopes itself with <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">a very thick peptidoglycan cell wall and a protein coat made up of many different proteis</span>.
2. Sporulation in Bacilus *subtilis* : starvation signal drives a <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">kinase-driven</span> series of events that leads to activation of alternative polymerase factors in the forespore, ones which are localized in the mother cell modulates the <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">engulfment</span> process and ones localized in the prospore are responsible for <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">endospore wall</span> formation.
• ATP synthesis and the generation of proton motive force in bacteria
1. Bacterial ETC is analogous to eucaryotic ones, they all obtain electrons from <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">NADH</span>, and transfer electrons in order of <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">decreasing</span> reducing potential. ??Energy contribution can be measured by decoupling??
• Nutrient uptake <mark>mechanisms and transporters</mark> in bacteria

• Motility and chemotaxis in bacteria
1. Motility: The flagella is a hollow structure ~20nm in diameter and 20um long made of flagellin that grows by addition of peptides to its tip; at its base there exists an PMF-dependent mechanism (Reverse ATPase), comprises <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">Stator, which is the motA/motB channel, and the rotor, which is the central rod and C/P rings</span>. this mechanism is driven by proton motive force that induces torque in the flagellum by chemiosmosis of H$^+$ through the <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">motA/B channel</span>. The pH gradient which induces this is created by the action of the bacterial electron transport chain
2. Chemotaxis is driven by kinase acctivity induced by cell surface receptors, in the prescence of beneficial stimuli and in the abscence og harmful stimuli, flagellum moves in anticlockwide and bacterium is in "run"phase. in the absence of beneficial stimuli and presence of harmful stimuli, the bacterium flagella spins in clockwise and enters "tumble" phase. on the molecular level, one class of attractant receptors known as <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">Methy-accepting chemotaxis proteins</span>(MCPs) initiates a two-component pathway <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">cheA/cheY</span>, the former interactes with MCP forming a receptor complex that inhibits its autophosphorylation activity, which prevents it from activating the latter, which modulates protein function in the <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">C/P</span> rings in the flagella motor, which changes rotation direction of flagella. Further, there is methylation on the cytoplasmic terminal of MCP receptors, which <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">increases</span> along increasing attractant binding on the periplasmic terminal. High level of phosphorylation in the MCP cytoplasmic terminal inhibit <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">cheA autophosphorylation</span>.
• Extracellular structures such as fimbriae, capsules and S-layers and their role in adaptation to the environment
1. Fimbriae are polypeptide structures that extend from the bacterial cell surface that are not made of flagellin. They grow from addition of subunits at the base. 
2. Capsules are layers of less cross-linked, highly aqueous polysaccharide, they are a stress adaptation that allow bacteria resist phagocytosis. They also barricades hydrophobic hazards from reaching the bacterial cell surface 
• Mechanisms employed by bacteria to attach to and interact with eukaryotic cells
1. fimbriae tipped with adhesins that reconize and bind to host molecules. In Neisseria *gonorrhoeae*, there are silent tandem duplications of the pilin gene, which could replace the active copy via homologus recombination. This confuses HLA-II in B cells/dendritic cells, and incurrs immune evasion
2. Upon activation by both bacterial and host factors, type III injectosomes; which are evolutionarily related to flagella base rotor, and derive energy both from EMF and ATP; export their distal portions and assemble into an effector complex translocon, which injects virulence factors to the host cell
## Cell-cell communication & Signal Transduction
• The basic mechanisms of cell-cell communication including juxtacrine, autocrine, paracrine &
endocrine signaling. From gap junctions and plasmodesmata (metabolic or electrical coupling),
to contact-dependent signaling, neurotransmitter release at short range to hormone release at
long range
1. metabolic/electrical coupling: Plasmodesmata in plants facilitate cytoplasm sharing between adjacent calls through the <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">desmotubule</span>, this is important in the sense that plants are multicellular, so that <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">positional information</span> inferred by <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">concentration gradients</span> of proteins, mRNAs and silencing signals. Intercalated discs in cardiac muscles seperate individual cardiomyocytes, hence they are not real syncytiums. But the gap junction that is the intercalated disk allows for potential migration across the cell junction, making the cell a <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">functional</span> syncytium. The cells are laterally anchored by desmosomes.
• Packaging of cargo for export: protein synthesis and export via the trans-golgi network and the secretory pathway versus vesicular transporter-mediated packaging of synaptic vesicles (with provision of online resources)
• Neurotransmission as a specialized form of calcium-dependent exocytosis. Resting membrane potential and depolarization, the action potential, voltage-dependent calcium channels (with provision of online resources).
• Signalling via ligand-gated ion channels: neurotransmitter binding and gating of ion channels.
Acetylcholine and end plate potentials at the neuromuscular junction. Glutamate and GABA
receptors, excitation and inhibition.
1. <span style="color:transparent; background-color: black;">Nicotine-Cholinergic receptors</span> at the neuromuscular junction are ligand-gated Na channels. Ca dependent exocytosis of Ach that diffuses to the postjunctional membrane, binding to ligand-gated Na channels and inducing action potential. Such potentiation spreads via T tubules to open Ca channels in the terminal cisternae of the sacroplasmic reticulum, inducing calcium transient and subsequent contraction
2. 
• Highly conserved components of intracellular signal-transduction pathways-G proteins used as
on/off molecular switches; protein kinases/phosphatases employed in virtually all signalling
pathways; second messengers carry and amplify signals from many receptors. Concept of
crosstalk between signalling pathways. Signal termination.
• General elements of G protein coupled receptor systems. GPCRs that activate or inhibit adenylyl cyclase. GPCRs that activate phospholipase C. Mechanisms that downregulate signalling from GPCRs. Integrating responses of cells to environmental influences.
1. GPCRs are heterotrimers, comprised of alpha, beta and gamma subunits, the Alpha subunit is a autophosphotase, and its ground state binds to GDP rather than GTP. Ligan binding exchanges the GDP for GTP, which causes the alpha subunit to detatch from the oligotrimer and can then activate or inhibit downstream proteins. Cholera endotoxin stabilises this active form and causes the GPCR pathway to remain active, analogous to gain-of-function mutations in Ras and B-r
2. 
• Receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. EGF). Activation of ras and MAPK pathways. The role of protein binding domains in the specific interactions between signalling molecules. Pathways that involve signal-induced protein cleavage (e.g. Notch/Delta signalling).
1. MAPK: 
• Signalling networks that respond to changes in nutrient and energy status of cell (e.g. SnRK1
and TOR kinases in plants). Signalling pathway conservation between organisms. Defects in
signalling pathways leading to disease with emphasis on cancer.

## Development
• Organising a body plan in multicellular organisms: The concepts of multicellular life and how an
organized body plan, composed of different cell types and tissues, is established. Examples of
relatively simple (hydra) organisms to the most complex (examples of drosophila, mouse, human
and others) will be used. Fundamental similarities and differences in the organisation of animals
and plants will be covered. Molecular and biophysical mechanisms governing cellular behaviour
will be discussed.
• Cell signalling/cell communication in the context of development . Cell communication is fundamental to building an organized body plan. The main developmental signalling pathways (Wnt, BMP, Hedgehog, FGF, YAP/hippo etc) will be introduced with examples of how they guide development. Pathway conservation and elaboration through evolution related to developmental complexity will be examined.
1. Receptors; Wnt: frizzled recetor and co-receptor, BMP: 
2. Source: Wnt, BMP, hippo and FGF from the dorsal source and Hedgehog from the ventrical source
3. Effect: High shh in the neural tube = motor neurons, high BMP and Wnt =  sensory neurons
• Elaboration of positional information over time. Exploration of key concepts, moving from the "French flag model" to more sophisticated ways of thinking. The concept of gradients and graded influence across tissues. Progressive specification and how information builds over developmental time. Cell lineage analysis and tracing a cell through time. Stem cells and how stem cell niches are established during development.
1. Cell fate: a cell undergoes progressive change during development and commits gradually to its final role in the organism. A cell positioned in a locality where its fate is known still undergoing specification to its cell fate may commit to other cell fates if grafted to other localities, but a cell that has undergone determination cannot.
2. French Flag model -> that cell fate - which cells must give rise to which cell patterns - is determined by concentration at a specific position at a  specific developmental phase of a "morphogen". C. elegans vulval developement, where an anchor cell secretes EGF and epithelial cells closest to it develope to inner vulva and vice versa, and maternal effect gene *bicoid* in Drosophila are both examples of simple gradient morphogens. However segmentation genes such as Shh are not simple gradient morphogens, and in the vulva example the inner vulval cells produce a secondary signal that induces lateral inhibition on adjacent cells, so gradient is also not the only factor. Lateral inhibition is often done in the form of Delta-Notch pathway (juxtacrine)
3. Positional information is traced temporally using in situ hybridisation or transgenetic insertion of probes. This could be done by transgenetic primer specific GFP expression, in recent years XFPs - engineered flourescent proteins allow for many cell lineages to be traced simutaneously in the same organism. More recently, cre recombinase can be placed after primers expressing genes known to be expressed at a certain development stage, that acts as a "primer gene" that cleaves off a blocking sequence that inhibits a probe sequence. So that this probe is only expressed in cells at this development stage. Since Cre activity requires cofactors, the intensity of the probe signal can also be modified by controlling concentration of cofactors.
• How a cell responds to positional information. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation leading to cellular differentiation. The integration of different types of  information at the cellular level determining how a cell responds. The importance of the cellular context and epigenetics. Hox genes and how they relate to positional information – the concept of a positional code. Mutations that change the body plan.
• Evolution & Development : How body plans can change through evolution. The concept of “the
Toolkit” for building an organism and “tinkering with the toolkit” – genetic changes that can lead
to major body plan shifts such as loss of limbs or acquisition of specialised structures such as a
turtle shell.
• Organogenesis : Development of organ and organ systems; e.g. heart, kidney, lung etc. building
on the concepts and mechanisms involved in building complex structures, current knowledge on
how specific organs are established will be presented and explained.
