## Millikan's oil drop experiment

Millikan's oil drop experiment is designed to prove the quantum property of **Charge**, it was conducted by Robert Millikan in 1911.

### ==Procedure==

Produce a string of very fine oil drops using an atomiser between [two charged capacitor plates with a constant E's electric field](E:\Core subjects\笔记树\Physics\Content\Capacitance.md), with direction opposite to gravitational field. According to Newton's first law, a stationary body must have a resultant force of 0. [Measuring the viscosity of air and terminal velocity measures the radii of the droplets](E:\Core subjects\笔记树\Physics\Content\Hard body mechanics (Newtonian).md), which can be used to calculate the mass of and gravitational force on each droplet. *A beam of ionising radiation is used to induce a charge on oil droplets*. For all droplets stationary, droplets have a resultant force of zero due to *an equilibrium between electric force and gravitational force*. The electric force is due to constant $E$ between the capacitor plates and the induced charge on the droplets. A lens is used to observe the equilibrium positions of droplets.

### Formulas

The Millikan's oil drop experiment explores the quantum nature of charge, since an oil drop is induced a *negative* charge, there is a $V_q$ constantly applied upwards, this upward force is equivalent to the downward gravitational force. The relationship between these two forces
