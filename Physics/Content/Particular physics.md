  The strong nuclear force acts *<u>between nucleons</u>*, overcoming [electrostatic repulsion](E:\Core subjects\笔记树\Physics\Content\Fields.md) to maintain nucleus integrity. It is *repulsive* acting on distances <u>below</u> $1.2^{-15}$ where it becomes *attractive*. It is negligible acting on distances greater than $2^{-15}$ metres.

  The strong nuclear force is deducible from **binding energy**, which can be derived from , *Fe-56 nuclei have the greatest binding energy*.
