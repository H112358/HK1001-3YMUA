Plant physiology

* Transpiration does not require energy consumption
* In paleobotany leaves is the main proxy of taxtonomy
    * Shape: Blade; Size, shape, perimeter, thickness, <mark>venation</mark>. Petiole; Length;, 
    * Petiole: allows mechanical flexibility - reduces self-shading and cools blade; circulation disrupts humid boundary layer and increases transpiration/photosynthesis - <mark>Does this reduce **temperature** of the leaf surface? Since H2O has better $\mathbb{c}$?</mark>
* Fate of light: 
    * 50% nonabsorbed
    * 15% reflection
    * 10% heat dissipation
    * 20$ metabolism
    * 5% carbohydrate
    * CITE *Plant physiology and developement 7e fig 11.2*
* Trichomes
    * Diverse
    * Defence, reduce waterloss, regulates light and temperature
* Chlorenchyma
    * Palisade parenchyma: apoxial surface - limiting factor is RuBiSCo, more compact cells with more chlotoplast
    * Spongy parenchyma: more air spaces
    * Shading is a signal that inhibits palisade parenchymal development - less palisade parenchyma in shaded leaves, also difference in phytochrome composition.
* Influx of CO2 must pass through three boundaries
    * Intercellular air space -> Mesophyll: mesophyll resistance, ~~affects photosynthesis most closely?~~
    * Stomatal resistance
    * Boundary layar resistance
* Phloem
    * Sieves, companion cells and fibers
    * ~~Syncytium?~~
    * Bidirectional transport of sugars and hormones
* Xylem
    * Tracheids - long, bordered pits and secondaty walls; Vessels - short, simple pits and end wall perforations
* Sclerenchyma
    * Fibers - sterile, large cells, allows light to penetrate
    * Scleroids - 
* C4 and Kranz anatomy - PEP Carboxylase in mesophyll cells; different chlotoplast anatomy; RuBiSCo in bundle sheath ~~Sclerenchyma?~~
* Stomatal morphologies: Dicotalydonous {~~Check presentation slides~~} vs monocotalydonous{Cellulose, MLG's, pextose}
* Blue light activates proton pump and is responsible for stomata opening
* ABA activated calcium messenging is responsible for stomata closure
