## Light reactions

* PSII is located in the thylakoid
* Emerson Enhancement effect
    * Despite quantum yield (${photons \space engaged \space in \space photochemistry}\over{total \space photons \space captured}$) being lower for far-red compared to red light, both wavelengths(?) are required for effective photosynthesis
    

### Anatomy

* LHCII's flank PSII, LHCI's flank PSI, PSII's are stacked together on thylakoid membrane, PSI not
* What triggers the light-dark transition in CAM plants?


### Protein Structures

* Absorption spectrum of photochromes contrast that of atomospheric absorption
    * Antennae complex: clorophyll a&b sends energy to reaction centre via resonance
    * P680+ is strongest oxidising agent that occurs in organisms
    * * Plastoquinone undergoes formational change after electron aquisition to enable crossing of the lipid membrane
    * P700+ recieves its eelctron from plastocyanin, hence is less oxidising than 680

### Biochemical process engineering

RuBP regeneration - transaldases/transketolase

### In vivo / virtro monitoring






### Misc
* Rieske iron-sulfur protein isconnected to Cytochrome *f* - why?
