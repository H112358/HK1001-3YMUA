## Ecology
J. Waterman - behaviour ecology

* Transfer of heat in between trophic levels - how?
    * 
* Net primary production - deducing the metabolism? respiration? of autotrophs - measured using dry mass of autotrophic organism


* Autochonous vs allochonous: input of material from local/foreign region - causes benthic environements to comprise of more consumer biomass than producer biomass
* Invertebrates have greater production efficiency - more assimilants actually turned into biomass
