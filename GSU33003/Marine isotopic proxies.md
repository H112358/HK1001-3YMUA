# Marine isotopic proxies

## $\delta18$O
* Standard is <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB)</span>
* Global distribution of oxygen isotopes is very much a result of Raleigh distillation in the water cycle: O18 is selected against in the atmosphere, so when precipitation occurs in the cold polar regions where the air is more easily saturated, the vapour content that forms percipitation is depleted in O18
* Expansion of ice sheets cause more O16 to be retained in icesheets and enrichment in marine O18, since resolution of glacial/stadial cycles are in orders of $10^4$ vs global ocean mixing $10^2$, a good proxy for ice sheet volume
* Also a good indicator for barystatic sea level
* In the sedimentary archive $\delta18O$ preserved by formanifera
    * Rate of fractionation from water to foram is temp. dependent: <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">~.02%</span> reduction in uptake per +1  $^\circ C$.
    * Vital effects: we don't know the physiology of the ancient forams, so could only use similarly classified modern forams of similar size as a representation.
