# Quaternary

* Paleoclimate
    * Historical context
    * Historical contingency
* N Caledonia - refugium to EECM



## Carbon Dating

* C14 undergoes $\beta$ decay into N
    * $\lambda$ 5730yrs
* $8\lambda$  is a watershed for dating feasibility
* Enrichment of C14 is most common in benthic lifeforms as 95% of C14 is dissolved in oceans in form of carbonates, less than 5% is captured by [photosynthetic assimilation](../BOU33123/Plant%20biochemistry.md)
* Using C14 as a proxy
    * Is C14/C12 contingent throughout geological history?
        * No, tree ring counting show difference between C14 years / calendar year
        * Modern model value is not accurate representation - needs calibration
    * Is carbon fully mixed rapidly across systems?
        * No. deep ocean water has, depending on circulation pattern, limited replenishment of C14 from atmosphere, glacial water has no replenishment at all
    * Is organic C14/C12 ratios similar to atomspheric ratios?
        * No. Fractionation effects of [photosynthetic assimilation](../BOU33123/Plant%20biochemistry.md) meant that there is less C14 in organic matter than in atmosphere.
        * Atmospheric C13/C12 ratio contigent (standard is Pee Dee Belemnite), C13 also experiences fractionation effect - used as calibration
