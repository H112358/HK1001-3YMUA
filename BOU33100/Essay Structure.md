## Narrative

* Cryptochromes are a class of flavoproteins highly conserved on their N-domain
    * The N-Terminal is responsible for blue-light-mediated repair of pyimidine dimerisation in photolyase2023 and MaestreReyna2023 for mechanistic insight, a
    * Photllyase is present in all domains of cellular life, it was first reported in Streptomyces griseus where it induced RESSURECTION from UV-irradiated cells (Kelner1949)(Poor old lad termed "100,000- to 400,000-fold recovery", made every effort to confirm this was actually true and caused by irradiance, but lad didn't realise it's the same type of light that kills the cell that ressurects it, thought it's visible light instead) 
* Cryptochromes become photoactivated by photoexcitation or photon absorption and photoreduction of the FAD chromophore (83, 101, 141), which results in conformational changes, such as disengagement of the PHR and CCE domains (112, 121, 179, 184) and formation homodimers that interact with (possibly PAS domain of, as highlighted by Jarillo2001) signalling partners through their CCE domain (Lin2023 talks about interaction with circadian regulators in D. melanogaster, ), however the exact mechanism of this is not well understood at the molecular level due to lack of temporally fine imaging techniques being applied (Palayam2021 captured crystalised tetramer).

* Cryptochromes

* Optogenetic techniques have been developed to utilize this oligomerization... Optogenetic approaches have recently been leveraged to dissect the biophysical properties of biomolecular condensates by fusing the photolyase homology region (PHR) domain of the Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) (19) to various IDR domains, enabling inducible and reversible condensation in living cells (14–18).
