Meristem



* Undifferentiated
* Thin cell wall and large nuclei



Auxin

* participates in multiple physiologies

* High concentration at bottom of embryo

Ehylene

* Gaseous hormone

Embryogenesis

Vegetative phase

Reproductive phas

Senescence



Phases of embryogenesis

* Zygote (establishment of apical-basal axis)
* Globular
* Heart (this is the stage where auxin accumulates at the base)(establishment of bilateral symmetry)
* Torpedo
* Mature

Vegetative phase

* Mostly interplay between C0 phase and cell division in somatic cells

Stem growth

* Shoot apical meristem
  * Central zone: plant body
  * Peripheral zone: primordia of leaves
  * Rib zone: central tissues e.g. vascular bundle
  * 3-layered embryo
* Root apical meristem
  * Cap (mechanical protection)
  * Meristematic zone (division)
  * Elongation zone (undifferentiated elongation, hormone action)
  * Maturation zone (distinct morphologies)

Leaves become carbon source early in development (when?)



Flowering hints



Flowering locus T

* regulates FKS

* regulated by transcription factor CONSTANS 



Senescence

* Monocarpic (annuals)
* Senescence of aerial shot (herbaceous plants)
* Leaf senescence (sequential)
* Senescence of flesh fruits
* E.g.
* Driven by ethylene
* Respiration (CO2) and Ethylene increases: cell wall hydrolysis via invetase, peetanase, etc.
* D
