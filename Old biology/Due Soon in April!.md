Write a maximum 3 page essay on the following: Describe an experimental design to test the 4 hypotheses stated below that address the effects of hormones on enzyme activity during barley seed germination. Provide a detailed description of the expected results and why these results would support each hypotheses.
 
Hypotheses:
1. The enzyme alpha-amylase is produced by cells in the <mark>part of the seed other than the embryo</mark>.
2. The production of alpha-amylase only <mark>occurs when gibberellic acid (GA3) is present</mark>.
3. The GA3, found naturally in germinating seeds is <mark>only produced by the embryo.</mark>
4. That <mark>abscisic acid (ABA) is antagonistic to GA3 </mark>in triggering alpha-amylase production.

Of which: 
A: Amylase is produced.

B: GA₃ is present.

C: GA₃ is produced by the embryo.

D: ABA is present.

A → B
B → A
(A ~ B)
B → C
D → (B ∧ ¬A)

The first statement did not make it clear whether amylase is produced in the embryo. Hence we discuss both the scenario in which it is produced by or not by the embryo v

Design for Hypothesis 1: Amylase is produced by cells in the part of the seed other than the embryo

* Null to test against: Amylase is not prodeced by cells in the seed other than the embryo
    * Manipulator variable: presence of cells in the embryo
    * Predictor variable: alpha amylase production
* Amylase production can be tested through measuring reaction with starch culture medium
    *
