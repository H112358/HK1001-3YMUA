## Membrane processes

### Reception

* Receptor pathways overview **WIP**
    * G-protein coupled receptor
        * G-protein is a heterotrimer with $\alpha , (\beta , \gamma)$ subunits, whereby <ins>the former binds covalently to the recptor</ins>? the latter two subunits always exist as a heterodimer, which covalently binds to PiPs and Sphingomyelin. The receptor is further anchored on the membrane by hydrophobic regions on N terminus of $\alpha$ chain and C terminus of $\gamma$ subunit, $\alpha$ subunit, a GTPase, binds to GDP in its inactive state. activation by binding of substrate leads to disassociation of $\alpha$ subunit from G-protein as it now binds to a GTP instead, the G protein subunits are liberated and free to move laterally across membrane to interact membrane proteins
        * Typically followed by activation of kinase and phosphorylation of secondary messenger / ion channel
        * Termination by intrinsic GTPase activity / GAP (GTPase Activation Proteins) donate R residue; $\beta$ arrestin desensitise receptor by binding to phosphorylated cytosoic C terminal, and signals endocytosis of receptors. Phosphotase activity recycles receptors to cell surface. [Arrestin Signalling](https://doi.org/10.1124/pr.109.002436)
    * Ligand-gated ion channel
    * Y-kinase coupled receptor
        * e.g. Erythropoietin 
    * Catalytic receptors
        * e.g. GLUT
* <mark>Most lipophilic molecules don't have surface receptors, but prosteoglandin is one exception</mark> (stub)
* <mark>Kinases mostly attack hydroxyl groups, that is, they mostly target S/Y/T amino acid residues, their effect is countered by phosphotases, phosphorylated proteins can remain in the cytoplasm and modulate enzymatic / hormonal function (fast effect), can enter the nucleus and modulate expression (slow effect). Phosphate group has -2 charge and can form <ins>3+</ins>? H bonds with other species</mark> (stub)
* <mark>Secondary messengers such as cAMP act on target proteins by binding to specific loci e.g. protein kinase A (PKA) has 2 R(egulatory) subunits and 2 c(atalytic) subunits,  each R subunit has two cAMP attachment loci, c/R subunits detatch when both loci are bound by cAMP</mark> (stub)
* <mark>G(i) family of proteins can be activating or inhibiting, controls AMP cyclase hence PKA (which is bound to microtubule/membrane by a <ins>protein</ins>(?), of course secondary messengers other than PKA and cAMP exists, such as IP$_3 ^-$/DAG (which is the 2nd messenger for angiotensin)</mark> (stub)
* <mark>IP$_3 ^-$ pathway: phospholipase C splits PiP2 (一种磷酸肌醇) into IP$_3 ^-$ and DAG, IP$_3 ^-$ enters cytoplasm to bind to calcium channels on the ER, leading to calcium efflux from the ER, and activation of protein kinase C, which then binds to DAG on the cell surface.</mark>(stub)
* <mark>Ca$^{2+}$ is a strong oxygen-containing species associated ligand, it regulates the action of an EF-hand protein - calmodulin - which binds four calcium ions with its EF chain and is activated through a conformational change exposing hydrophobic surfaces.</mark>
* <mark>Insulin receptor has two subunits: surface $\alpha$ and self-phosphorylising $\beta$ (three key Y residues)</mark>
* <mark>PDK1 phosphorylates single chained -OH residues (S/T)</mark>

### Vesicle trafficking

* Neuronic electrophysiology **WIP** **Move where appropriate**
    * Na/K ATPase consumes <ins>80%</ins>? of energy demand of a neuron to maintain cross membrane PD of ~-70v; the membrane is partially permeable to potassium but wholly impermeable to sodium.
    * e.g. E amino acid salts (glutamates) bind to ligand-gated sodium channels and facilitate depolarisation of membrane to -55v where voltage-gated sodium/potassium channels open and action potential.
    * Notice that <ins>diffusion Keq</ins>? is greater for potassium than calcium, this is due to $\psi _e$ across membrane and that potassium is less electron dense than sodium.
* Control of vesicle fusion at active zones on synapses
