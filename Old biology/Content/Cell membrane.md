# Cell Membrane



## Prokaryotic origin



## Electrophysiology

​	The cell membrane could possess diverse membrane proteins responsible for the control of the distribution of charge across the membrane.

#### Action potential

​	

## Cytoskeleton

- Actin filaments bundle together to form strutctural support to the cellular membrane
