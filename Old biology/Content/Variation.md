# Variation



## ==Definition==

Variation is the result of 

## !==Biodiversity==!

### Species diversity

- The property that measures the *richness* and *evenness* of species in an ecosystem
- **Species richness** is defined by the number of different species in the ecosystem
- **Species evenness** is defined by the number of each different species in the ecosystem

### Ecosystem diversity 

- The property that measures the *variety* of habitats in an ecosystem

### Measuring biodiversity

#### 	Sampling techniques dom sampling

- - Mark-release-recapture
    - A large population is collected and marked before being released back into the habitat, a second population is collected after sufficient time and the frequency of marked individuals is recorded.
- Systematic sampling
  - Line transect
    - A long line is subtended across the area of interest, at regular intervals or continuously, the number of organisms about the line is counted using a set square.

#### 	Abundance

- Species frequency

  - Chance for a particular species being found within any quadrat

- Species density

  - The measure of how many individuals there are per unit area 

- Percentage cover

  - Measured using a $1m^2$ quadrat, The Braun-Banquet scale can also be used

    | Braun-Banquet scale | Range of cover (%)   |
    | ------------------- | -------------------- |
    | 5                   | 75-100               |
    | 4                   | 50-75                |
    | 3                   | 25-50                |
    | 2                   | 5-25                 |
