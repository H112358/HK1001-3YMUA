# Platectonics



Locating the temporal and space characteristics of a paleo-rock 

- Radioactivity
- Paleomagnetism
- Fossil strata (stratigraphic range)



U-238 --> Pb (Cryolite)

​	Folding cause Pb to be lost from crystal



Paleolatitude - magnetism: clastic sediments/rock crystals

​	Apparent polar wandering: reversing of magnetic polarization between geological strata, locating position of palaeocontinents/dating expansion of paleo oceans

古人有意识到地磁偏转，老中骄傲时刻

Glacial effect: trimming on land, deposition in water (fine mud + dropstones)
