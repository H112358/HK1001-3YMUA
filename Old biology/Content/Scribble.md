1.i) Light intensity ii)  limiting factor is a variable involved in a specific experiment that dictates the value of the independent variable since all other factors affecting the experiment are in excess iii) Light intensity is now in excess, hence another variable has become the limiting factor iv) Temperature rises above optimum temperature of enzymes involved in photosynthesis; some of the enzyme has denatured, hence changing the shape of their active site and less enzyme-substrate complexes are formed, hence reducing photosynthetic rate



2.i)  Limiting factor is the experimental factor that dictates the rate of the experiment. CO2 concentration would determine the rate of photosynthesis if all other factors (light intensity, water) are given in excess ii) To eliminate effect of root CO2 absorption on experimental results,  **also to prevent CO2 produced by soil organisms to enter the upper chamber and interrupt the result** iii) Since all other variables were kept constant, CO2 concentration is the limiting factor in this experiment. Experiment A used half the CO2 concentration used in experiment B, and achieves a lower maximum rate of photosynthesis at 3.6 AU than achieved in experiment B at 2 AU; the slope of increase of photosynthetic rate of set B exceeds that of set A, at 0.5 to 0.3. iv) Carbon dioxide concentration is positively related to maximum rate of photosynthesis, since the limiting factor of the maximum rate of reaction v) Rubisco could be present in excess in D, **an adaptation to high CO2**, and there could be more chloroplast per unit volume of leaf in D. There could also be more stoma in D to allow greater rate of diffusion of CO2 to the mesophyll cells



4.i) C4 plants undergo Calvin cycle in bundle sheath cells, CO2 **carboxylates** first into **PEP and oxaloacetate** then into malic acid in mesophyll, which is transferred to and decarboxylated in the cytoplasm of bundle sheath cells, where the Calvin cycle then takes place. Plants undergoing the C3 pathway undergoes both photophosphorylation and the Calvin cycle in the cytoplasm of mesophyll cells. (*over word limit*) ii) CO2 fixation in C4 plants, at respectively 3.5, 3.1 and 2.9; are  higher than those of C3 plants, at 1.6 and 1.7. iii) Rubisco carboxylates RuBP to initiate Calvin cycle iv) Since the Calvin cycle is undergone in the C4 plants from the CO2 released from malate oxidation, this rate is the limiting factor for the production of substrate of the RuBP-CO2 reaction, whilst PEP carboxylation is limited only by the rate of diffusion of atmospheric CO2 into the leaf air spaces, also the limiting factor with respect to RuBiSCo in C3 plants(*Over word limit*) iv) C4 plants grow in tropical regions, where there is abundant sunlight to produce ATP via photophosphorylation
