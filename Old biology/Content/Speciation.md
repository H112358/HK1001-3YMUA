## Definitions

**Speciation** is the formation of fertile offspring from a population that is unable to interbreed with the original population.



A **species** is a *group of organisms unable to interbreed with organisms outside this group*, they <u>may</u> share *similar morphology and behaviour*.



## ==Theories==

Speciation is classified according to the cause of speciation or the result of speciation.

- From the cause of speciation, speciation can be classified as **Allopatric and sympatric**.
  - Allopatric speciation occurs when *geological isolation* occurs between two populations and *genetic flow* is hence prohibited between the two populations, resulting in speciation due to the accumulation of different mutations.
  - Sympatric speciation occurs when there is *no geological isolation* between two populations, speciation takes place due to different selection pressure on the two populations or a mutation that changes the behaviour of a population causing it to not be able to mate with the other population.
- From the result of speciation, speciation can be classified as **Prezygotic and postzygotic**.
  - Prezygotic speciation describes where one species *cannot [produce a zygote]()* with another species, due to behavioural, mechanical or cellular differences.
  - Postzygotic speciation describes where one species cannot produce *viable offspring or fertile offspring* with another species due to polyploidy or genetic differences.

### Polyploidy and speciation

***Polyploidy*** is where an organism has *more than 2 sets of complete chromosomes* in *every cell*

- **Autopolyploid** is a form of polyploidy where the polyploid offspring derives *from a single parental species*, examples are parthenogenesis in animals and self-fertilisation in plants
- **Allopolyploid**  is a form of polyploidy where the polyploid offspring derives *from different parental species*, this is due to *failed cytokinesis in meiosis I of parental gamete(s)*, producing viable and fertile offspring.
