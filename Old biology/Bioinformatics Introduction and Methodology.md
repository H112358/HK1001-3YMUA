## Unit 1: What is bioinformatics



Genome + mDNA, epigenetics and environment "manual of life"

Human genome 3.1e9 bp, 2.9% structural

?Locating single mutations in large genome?

Large data - high throughput technology generates quickly growing high amount of low signal-to-noise ratio data of differing types
