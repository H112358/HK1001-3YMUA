## Chp8

- Importance of mycelium
  - Intermedium of evolution in fungal lifestyle
  - Site of morphogenetic promotion/restriction of diversification under epidotic selection pressures
- Development of mycelium
  - Originates from homogenous point source
  - Establishment of marginal growth zone for leader hyphae via changes in morphogenesis patterns
  - Adaptability to different environmental conditions via variation in develpoment patterns
  - Determination of pre/post transcriptional mode swtiches:
    - discontinuous response to gradation in an environtment parameter
    - Correlation between morphogenetic pattern and a gene or product
    - Correlation between patterns forementioned and ploidy/heterokaryosis
    - Sustained pattern under non-inductive conditions
    - Consistant expression of mycelial diorphism/polimorphism under specific conditions by same genotype
    - Two or more individualy expressed morphogenetic patterns can be shown to be components whose co-experssion results in another morphogenetic pattern
    - Distinct functional role of a morphoenetic state
  - Mycelial-yeast dimorphism: Slow-dense/fast-effuse - is it a diploid - tetraploid secondary homoahllic cycle?

Wall morphogenesis, associated with ion flux modulations, of activation of phenol oxidase and associated systems, and mobile controlling elements play cenral roles as per conclusion of the chapter.
