## Promoting Biodiversity in Irish Forestry: policies and challenges

### Ireland has climate conditions ideal for temperate forests...

Ireland currently has 11% of its landmass covered by forest \cite{FoodMarineA2023}, this is much lower than the EU average at 39% \cite{Eurostat}, and a significant contrast to the 80% potential cover defined by fundamental niches of tree species \cite{Cross1998}. Historically, pollen records had shown that Irish forests probably reached their maxima before the onset of the Irish neolithic, before slash-and-burn farming and grazing opened up the landscape. An almost complete removal of woodland from the Irish landscape was quickly reached following 1750 when fuel demand surged due to population increase following introduction of the potato, creating an open landscape only interspaced with exotic plantations afforested by English landlords around their estates. \cite{Mitchell1997} This landscape regime also led to loss of regional diversity in arboreal community composition adapted to the variable habitat types in Ireland, and . \cite{Cross1998} \cite{Cole2001} The Republic saw state afforestation programs which led to a major increase in 340000 hectares of woodland, however mostly of conifer high forest on open ground, or uplands deemed unsuitable for agricultural cultivation \cite{woodlandsurvey coillete}. The forested Irish landscape today is still dominated by high conifer woodland, primarily plantation silviculture of Sitka spruce, *Picea sitchensis*, whereas EEA-defined high natural value forests, mostly native or semi-natural woodland, cover only 1% of total land area in the Republic.

* Write about the geological history of vegetation in Ireland (Ice age earth, probably citing a few articles from encyc quat sci)
* Write about the topological and hydrological conditions of Ireland
* Write about fundamental niches of tree species and how they fit in

### Current state of Irish forest cover is a highly fragmented and non-native one...

*P. sitchensis* became preferred by the Irish forestry industry for its high lumber output under the most adverse site conditions in the Irish uplands \cite{foresters association} \cite{Stokes2022}. 

* Write about current state of patchiness of forest ecosystems: [This is a good source](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000912254100001)
* Write about how non-native species establishing and competitively excluding native species damage ecosystem services
* Discuss the current landscape of invasive species in Ireland

### *<span style="color: red;">Implications of the Sitka spruce plantation on biodiversity</span>*...

* Talk about possible impacts from different parts of rotarion
* Talk about impact on inland freshwater bodies
* Talk about biodiversity in afforestation v. reforestation

### Current policies to bring silvicultural change...

* Talk about grant schemes and their objectives

### Potential policies to bring silvicultural change...

* Talk about continuous cover forestry, talk about agroforestry
* Talk about initiatives and hinderence
