## Promoting Biodiversity in Irish Forestry: policies and challenges

### Ireland has climate conditions ideal for temperate forests...

Ireland currently has 11% of its landmass covered by forest \cite{FoodMarineA2023}, this is a significant contrast to the 80% potential cover defined by fundamental niches of tree species \cite{Cross1998}. Historically, pollen records had shown Irish forests to reach their maximum extent at 

* Write about the geological history of vegetation in Ireland (Ice age earth, probably citing a few articles from encyc quat sci)
* Write about the topological and hydrological conditions of ireland
* Write about fundamental niches of tree species and how they fit in

### Current state of Irish forest cover is a highly fragmented and non-native one...

* Write about current state of patchiness of forest ecosystems: [This is a good source](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000912254100001)
* Write about how non-native species establishing and competitively excluding native species damage ecosystem services
* Discuss the current landscape of invasive species in Ireland
