## Formation of amines



Formation is carried out using nucleophilic substitution of halogenoalkanes with liquid ammonia under pressure. The ammonia needs to be in excess due to: the product of the nucleophilic substitution, hydrogen bromide ($HBr$), which could react with the ethylamine, is removed by the excess ammonia. It forms ammonium bromide ($NH4Br$), it is also to note that amines are also nucleophiles and the excess ammonia reduces the rate at which they react with the halogenoalkane.



Another reaction used in the production of amines is the reduction of nitriles. First substitute the halogen group on a halogenoalkane using $CN^-$, then reduce the nitrile over a nickel catalyst or LithiumTetraHydridoAluminate ($LiAlH4$) in dry ether to add hydrogen to the $CN$ group.
