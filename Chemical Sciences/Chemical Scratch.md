the energy integral for any wave function
for a system must be equal to or greater than the energy of the lowest
state of the system



Inasmuch as the energy integral for any wave function
for a system must be equal to or greater than the energy of the lowest
state of the system, the energy of the actual bond between A and B will
either be equal to that for a normal covalent bond A B, or, in case the

bond has ionic character A +B - or A -B + in excess of that included in the
normal covalent bond, will be greater than this value. Hence, if our
postulate is true, actual bond energies will not show negative deviations
from additivity; the difference A between the actual bond energy and
the energy predicted for a normal covalent bond must be zero or posi-
tive, and the greater the ionic contribution to the bond, the greater will
be the value of A





 it is found that each bond function tends to overlap
to the maximum extent the other function involved in one bond, and to
avoid overlapping all others, so that the resonance integrals other than
those characteristic of the bonds are small
