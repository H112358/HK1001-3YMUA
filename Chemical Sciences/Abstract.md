## Electrons

### 	Electrons in their sub-atomic context

- Electrons carry a negative charge of $-e$, $-1.6 \times 10^{-19}C$, with a mass of $0.5M_eV/C$,  $9.1 \times 10^{-31} kg$; [Milliken's oil drop experiment demonstrates the quantum nature of electrons](E:\Core subjects\笔记树\Physics\Content\Experiments demonstrating quantum property.md).
- [Electrons can only exist in discrete energy levels around the nucleus, expressible by quantum numbers](E:\Core subjects\笔记树\Chemical Sciences\Content\Atomic models.md), [transition of an electron between two levels involves energy](E:\Core subjects\笔记树\Physics\Content\Quantum physics.md).
- ==Electrons can become excited by  absorbing photons and de-excited by releasing photons==
- ==Electrons are attracted to the nucleus==
  - ==Ionisation energy measures the work done needed to overcome the attractive force between electron and nucleus==
  - ==Electronegativity measures the relative affinity of bond electrons towards an atom in a covalent species==

## Chemical reaction

### 	Energy change of reactions

- [Enthalpy is a measure of total enthalpy change of a reaction is the summation of that of all the steps undergone](E:\Core subjects\笔记树\Chemical Sciences\Content\Enthalpy, entropy and free energy.md), [It is independent of reaction conditions](E:\Core subjects\笔记树\Chemical Sciences\Content\Reaction profile.md). Enthalpy is a measurement of internal energy stored in chemical bonding
