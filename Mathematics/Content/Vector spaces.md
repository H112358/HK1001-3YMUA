- Complex set: $\C = {a+bi : a,b \in \R}$
  - Commutativity; associativity; identities; additive iverse; multiplicative inverse and distributive property apply to complex numbers. Such that  for every $w,z \in \C$:
    - $w+z = z+w, wz=zw$
    - $(z_1+z_2)+z_3=z1+(z_2+z_3) \and (z_1z_2)z_3 = z_1(z_2z_3)$
    - $z+0 = z, z\times1 = z$
    - for every definable $z$ there exists an $z_0$ for which $z_0+z = 0$
    - for every definable $z$ there exists an $z_0$ for which $z_0 \times z = 1$
    - $\lambda(w+z) = \lambda w +\lambda z$ for all $\lambda$
