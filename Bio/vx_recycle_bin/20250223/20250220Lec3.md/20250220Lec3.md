## Principles of Pop genetics

* Types of variation
    * Single Nucleotide variation
    * In/Del
        * Insertion and deletions have same effect on observed genome
        * size varies
        * hard to spot with direct comparison methods - chimpanzees are 99% similar to humans discarding indels, but 95% when indels acccounted
* Gene pool size is 2N for an N numbered population since chromosomes have 2 arms
    * Allele frequency = $F_{(allele)} \over 2N$
        * SNVs with >1% frequency -> SNP
        * H-W Equilibrium: genotype freq derivable from allele freq
            * Random mating
            * No evolution
        * Wahlund effect: inbreeding
        * Allele frequency change: Mutation/Drift/Flow/Selection NOT selective mating
    *
