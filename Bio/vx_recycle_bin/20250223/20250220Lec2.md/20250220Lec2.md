* Her2 - human EGF receptor - gain of function in breast cancer
    * Ubiquintination tag triggers recruitment cascade that leads to degradation
    * Ras/BRaf - Gain of function through conformational change | <ins>why are their structures not evolutionarily modulated to maximum effeciency</ins>?
* Hayflick limit - loop formation on chrmsme ends with depleted telomere sequence
* Rous - Rous Sarcoma Virus
    * Dulbecco - cells transform when infected with RSV
    * Bishop&Varmus - Src gene
        * Expressed in somatic cells
        * Expressed across vertebrate realm
        * Triggers cell division
    * Viral infection  of RSV
        * Docking and injection into cytosol
        * Incorporate viral genome into host genome upon mitosis
        * Upexpression of Src
        * More mitosis and more incorporation
* Ras - a non-bound receptor-Gprotein pathway
    * Complex activation cascade
        * Nature selects the first solution - complex solution
        * Higher robustness
            * Gain-of-function muations in isolation - apoptosis/sceniscence
            * Co-mutation with e.g. p53 - transformation
            * Targeted drugs could provide selection pressure and mutate another part of the pathway
        * Mutation - P-loop site opens due to mutation of positions 12, 13
* B-Raf kinase
* 500-fold expression due to mutation V600E
* Inhibitor screening - easier to find a non-protein ligand than a protein - and bioavailability is also poorer for proteins
