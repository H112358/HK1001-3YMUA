## Cell fate

* Differential gene expression
    * irreversible
    * Germ layer (embryonic stem cells) -> cell type (progenitor cells)
        * Based on positional information (e.g. *melanogaster*: maternal effect genes/segmentation genes(first zygonotic(self)genes)/homeotic genes)
    * Positional information
        * molecular/biophysical
        * respond by proliferation/differentiation/transformation(formation of neural rube)/migration(neuro-crest cells)/apoptosis(nervous system - only <mark>strongly</mark> connected ones survive) - morphogenesis
            * Model organism - C. *elegans*: observation that certain lineages always die; followed by mutant screening: capcase-9
            * Cancer(refer to genetics)
            * D. *melagaster*ultrabithorax: third thorax also expresses wing/antennapedia: leg antenna both contain the homeobox sequence (160bp) mostly placed in exons - transcription factors
            * Homeotic? Hox? genes are clustered - expression/combined expression patterns unique to position: position in the cluster reflect position in the body plan - control factor<mark>s</mark> are shared
            * Labelling of position by Hox code (transcription factors)
            * Highly conserved Hox region: both sequence and cromosomal arrangements are conserved, although difference in function and gene duplications leading to functional differentiation
            * Hoxc8: knockout 1: one extra T vertebra, knockout all 3: every vetebrae becomes T
    * Stem cells can renew themselves
        * Pluripotent stem cells, multipopent stem cells, adult/embryonic stem cells
        * Resident stem cells proliferate and differentiate in response to cellular signals
        * Embryonic stem cells are found in the inner cell mass of blastocysts (pregastrulation), they can be propergated maintained as pluripotent stem cells or guided to differenciate
            * ESCs from surplus IVF: ethical? Adult SC's have too many control pathways to culture effeciently in the lab 
            * ESCs has four unique transcription factors (pluripotent factors), transfection of these to adult stem cells gives rise to pluripotent-like behaviour - iPS
            * Organoids: in vitro cultures of stem cells which mimick physiological conditions to induce differenciation and mimmick tissue function (cocktail o f signalling molecules + appropriate mechanical environment)
