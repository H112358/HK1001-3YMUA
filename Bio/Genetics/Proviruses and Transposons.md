# Proviruses and Transposons

- Proviruses and retroviruses
    - Endogenous Retrovirus
        - Body mass correlation
        - Paleovirus: source of phylogenic info
            - Basis: historical records/ molecular clocks or HERV
        - Infection of a Retrovirus on a germ cell
            - Vertical transmission - exo/endogenous inheritance
            - transition, e.g. Koala retrovirus
        - Provirus: LTR;gag;pro;en;LTR
            - LTR are initially identical, acts as mol clock
            - Stop codon insertion to silence negative/neutral selection
        - Placenta is a hotbed of ERV activity
            - Syncytins - drives cell-cell fusion, highly exprssed in placentae, captive ERV env
            - Different type of ERV in different mammalian lineages - seperate endogenous events - rodents have two different copies, even marsupials and placental lizards
                - Baton Pass hypothesis - one event before viviparous and one after -EnvV captured earliest - lost fusogenic activity; Sync2 perserved fusogenic activity, sync one lost in old world monkeys
