## Evolutionary events

### Small DNA Replication

## Principles of Pop genetics 

## *Placeholder* **WIP**
* Types of variation
    * Single Nucleotide variation
    * In/Del
        * Insertion and deletions have same effect on observed genome
        * size varies
        * hard to spot with direct comparison methods - chimpanzees are 99% similar to humans discarding indels, but 95% when indels acccounted
* Gene pool size is 2N for an N numbered population since chromosomes have 2 arms
    * Allele frequency = $F_{(allele)} \over 2N$
        * SNVs with >1% frequency -> SNP
        * H-W Equilibrium: genotype freq derivable from allele freq
            * Random mating
            * No evolution
        * Wahlund effect: inbreeding
        * Allele frequency change: Mutation/Drift/Flow/Selection NOT selective mating
    * Fitness
    * Total number of offspring (absolut fitness)
        * Average for genotype
    * Proportion to benchmark (relative fitness)
    * Contribution = freq * fit
        * $\sum{Contrib} = totalpopulationfitness$

### Cell fate

* Differential gene expression
    * irreversible
    * Germ layer (embryonic stem cells) -> cell type (progenitor cells)
        * Based on positional information (e.g. *melanogaster*: maternal effect genes/segmentation genes(first zygonotic(self)genes)/homeotic genes)
    * Positional information
        * molecular/biophysical
        * respond by proliferation/differentiation/transformation(formation of neural rube)/migration(neuro-crest cells)/apoptosis(nervous system - only <mark>strongly</mark> connected ones survive) - morphogenesis
            * Model organism - C. *elegans*: observation that certain lineages always die; followed by mutant screening: capcase-9
            * Cancer(refer to genetics)
            * D. *melagaster*ultrabithorax: third thorax also expresses wing/antennapedia: leg antenna both contain the homeobox sequence (160bp) mostly placed in exons - transcription factors
            * Homeotic? Hox? genes are clustered - expression/combined expression patterns unique to position: position in the cluster reflect position in the body plan - control factor<mark>s</mark> are shared
            * Labelling of position by Hox code (transcription factors)
            * Highly conserved Hox region: both sequence and cromosomal arrangements are conserved, although difference in function and gene duplications leading to functional differentiation
            * Hoxc8: knockout 1: one extra T vertebra, knockout all 3: every vetebrae becomes T
    * Stem cells can renew themselves
        * Pluripotent stem cells, multipopent stem cells, adult/embryonic stem cells
        * Resident stem cells proliferate and differentiate in response to cellular signals
        * Embryonic stem cells are found in the inner cell mass of blastocysts (pregastrulation), they can be propergated maintained as pluripotent stem cells or guided to differenciate
            * ESCs from surplus IVF: ethical? Adult SC's have too many control pathways to culture effeciently in the lab 
            * ESCs has four unique transcription factors (pluripotent factors), transfection of these to adult stem cells gives rise to pluripotent-like behaviour - iPS
            * Organoids: in vitro cultures of stem cells which mimick physiological conditions to induce differenciation and mimmick tissue function (cocktail o f signalling molecules + appropriate mechanical environment)
            
* Different trees for different loci - why?
    * Independent assortment of chromosomes?
    * Ancestral polymorphism?
    * Time of fixation of mutations relative to speciation is lost in present information
        * This plus ancestral polymorphism - chance for more distant relatives to carries same allele - discordance of gene tree to phylogeny
        * If fixation due to chance (drift) - scenario of accordance and discordance equal
        * Look at faster molecular clocks - more data - better genome matching
* Detect Gene flow
    * Intergression - flow of genetic information across species/subspecies - hybrdzation
    * Admixture - gene flow between two or more genetically distinguishable populations
    * Event of Neanderthals
        * Minority of loci show closer african sapiens - neanderthals
            * Violates hypothesis fixation is due to chance
            * Gene flow
        * ABBA-BABA test
            * Determination of gene flow
            * A(outgroup1)B(Species1)B(species1)A(outgroup2)
            * BABA - ABBA should have similar frequency if drift is main driving force
            * High ABBA = gene flow, can quantify
        * Neandethral alleles is decreasing in freaquency - deleterious
            * More bottlenecks in N populations than S populations
            * High deleterious load
* Recessive disorders
    * Selective forces works less
    * Especially following bottlenecks - low freq deleterious alleles becomes high in freq
        * E.g. Ashkenazi - Sachs disease
* Dominant disorders
    * May be less deleterious in early stages of life - not impact fertility hence fitness
    * Can be newly generated
        * Two individuals with same pathology buried together shows two different missense vs truncating mutations on two different loci - lightning can strike twice
    * On average 75 mutations vs parents
        * Women - long period of stasis
        * Sperm genesis - 23 divisions per year for each cell
            * Higher chance for autism in older fathers
* Complex disease - many alleles induce risk
    * Many low risk alleles
    * High risk alleles are mostly de novo
            
olduvai repeats - highest in humans
