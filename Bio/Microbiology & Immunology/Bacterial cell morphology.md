# Bacterial cell morphology

## Cell surface organisation (Ref. Prescott; misc)

### 1. Gram positive vs Gram negative?
* Common features include a <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">plasma membrane</span>; a peptidoglycan cell wall, <mark>peptidoglycans are composed of a <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">sugar (glycan)</span> backbone and <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">5-peptide (4 when interlinked)</span> side chains usually in order <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">L-ala > D-glu > L-DAP > D-ala (never varies) > D-ala</span>
       interconneced by <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">pentaglycine bridge</span> between the 4th <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">D-ala</span> residues.</mark> [Example murein monomer](#fig1)
    * Peptidoglycan is **elongated** via the enzyme<span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">undecaprenyldiphospho-*(N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-(N-acetyl-D-mu ramoylpentapeptide)*:undecaprenyldiphospho-(N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-( 1->4)-N-acetyl-D-muramoylpentapeptide) disaccharidetransferase (Peptidoglycan Glycosyltransferase)</span>, which facilitates the formation of a <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">β-(1→4) glycosidic bond</span> between glycosidic dimer <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">GlcNAc(1→4)MurNAc</span> carried by <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">lipid carrier</span> <mark>undecaprenyl diphosphate</mark>. Peptidoglycan **Turnover** is facilitated by lysins that acts against the <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">β-(1→4) glycosidic bond</span>. ([PNAS article: Crystal structure of a peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase suggests a model for processive glycan chain synthesis](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0701160104))
    * Peptidoglycan is **cross-linked** via the enzyme <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">DD-Transpeptidase</span>, which acts to transfer the R-L-aca-D-alanyl moeity of R-L-aca-D-alanyl-D-alanine carbonyl donors to the y-OH of their active-site serine and from this to a final acceptor. The molecue <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">pennicilin</span> acts to inhibit this enzyme by being a structural analog of the acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of nascent bacterial cell wall, hence binds to and acylates the active site of the enzyme. ([BiochemJ article: Streptomyces K15 active-site serine dd-transpeptidase: specificity profile for peptide, thiol ester and ester carbonyl donors and pathways of the transfer reactions](https://doi.org/10.1042/bj3070335) ; [PNAS article: Mechanism of penicillin action: penicillin and substrate bind covalently to the same active site serine in two bacterial D-alanine carboxypeptidases.](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.76.6.2730))


* <mark>**Gram positive bacteria**</mark> cell surface is organised **in order away from the cytoplasm** <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">plasma membrane</span> > <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">false "periplasmic" space</span> > <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">thick peptidoglycan wall</span>. Its cell walls present common occurances of <mark>peptide interbrige</mark>. In addition possesses high amounts of <mark>teichoic acids</mark>, which are <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">polymers of glycerol or ribitol joined by phosphate groups which the gram negative bacteria lacks</span>. amino acids such as d alanine and sugars such as glucose are attached to the alchoholic part of teichoic acids.
    * Teichoic acids are covalently anchored to either the peptidoglycan cell wall or the plasma membrane. In the latter case they are called <mark>lipoteichoic acids</mark>. Teichoic acids possess a <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">negative</span> charge, which determines for the Gram negative bacterial cell wall its overall charge.
        * Teichoic acids are transported to outside the bacterial cell membrane by the action of <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">SecYEG complex</span>, which is the main translocon in the prokaryotic cell. Wall teichoic acids and other cell wall polymers are attached by the action of <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">LytR-Cps2A–Psr (LCP)</span> family of proteins. <mark>**?**</mark> ([EMBO article: A widespread family of bacterial cell wall assembly proteins](https://doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2011.358))
    * The periplasm in Gram positive cells are often thin in proteins persumably due to the porous nature of the peptidoglycan wall, those proteins that do remain are usually attached to the plasma membrane.
    *  Gram-positive bacteria have a layer of proteins on the surface of their cell wall peptidoglycan. For example, the <mark>S-layer proteins</mark>, which are present on all Gram positive strains except A. *salmoncida* and exists as a <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">self-assembled, mechanically strong protein mesh</span>encapsulating the cell(see section 3), bind noncovalently to polymers scattered throughout the wall. Enzymes Involved In peptidoglycan synthesis and turnover also seem to interact noncovalently with the cell wall. An enzyme called <mark>sortase</mark> catalyzes the attachment of these surface proteins to the gram-positive <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">peptidoglycan pentaglycine bridge</span>. Sortases are attached to the plasma membrane of the bacterial cell.

* <mark>**Gram negative bacteria**</mark> cell surface is organised **in order away from the cytoplasm** <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">inner plasma membrane</span> > <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">periplasmic space</span> > <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">thin peptidoglycan wall</span> > <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">perisplasmic space</span> > <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">outer plasma membrane</span>
    * Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) are complex molecules on the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria that contain both lipid and carbohydrate, and typically consist of three parts: (1) lipid A, (2) the core polysaccharide, and (3) the O side chain. In some mucosal pathogens the core polysaccharide is modified by a phase-variable (on-off) extension of one or a few sugars and known as <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">lipooliogsaccharide</span>. LPS can be smooth or rough; those with O-sidechain (O-antigen) are known as <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">smooth</span> LPS, this modification <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">increases</span> **serum resistance** of the bacterial cell by interacting with the alternative complement cascade. Its moeity also barricades the outer membrane from bile salts, antibiotics, and other toxic substances. It also acts as a receptor to <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">bacteriophages</span>.
    * The O-sidechain is encoded by ... and is assembled onto the LPS core polysaccharide by ... **WIP** ()[Annu Rev Biochem Article: Biosynthesis and export of bacterial lipopolysaccharides.](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035600))
    * In contrast to teichoic and lipoteichoic acids, LPSs are toxic in their lipdA domain and therefore acts as a major endotoxin.

### 2. Evolution of microbe-associated molecular patterns?
* Cell surface morphology has motile and conserved components driven by different <mark>selection pressure</mark>
    * Bacteria are classified into <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">serotypes</span> according to their cell surface organisation.
   * In Gram+ bacteria, teichoic acids have relatively <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">conserved</span> backbones and <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">variable</span> modifications. 
    * In Gram- bacteria, LPSs are categorized according to the presence or absence of the O-sidechain into smooth and rough types, rough LPS is advantagous in terms of selection pressure from <mark>host immunity</mark>, since proinflammatory immune responses as well as <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs)</span> such as betadefensin in the epithelia target the O-sidechain.
    * In host cells, the receptor class <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">Toll-Like Receptors</span> are responsible for <mark>recognition of MMAPs</mark> [Receptor family overview](#fig2)
    * Bacterial strains with modified MMAPs (amino acid modification, deacylation, phosphorylation) are less likely to be recognised by host receptors and CAMPs, this <mark>reduces the inflammatory impact</mark> of these strains on host.
    * Other surface proteins are covalently attached to the peptidoglycan. Many covalently attached proteins, such as the M protein of pathogenic streptococci, have roles in virulence, such as aiding in adhesion to host tissues and interfering with host defenses. ... **WIP**

### 3. Extracellular components to the prokaryotic cell surace?
* Extracellular components of the prokaryotic cell surface includes the <mark>Capsule</mark> OR the <mark>Slime layer</mark> OR the <mark>S-layer</mark>; the <mark>Fimbriae</mark> OR the <mark>flagella</mark>.
    * The Capsule and slime layer are <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">hydrous</span> (hydrophilic/lipophilic) protection layers to ward off hazards such as <mark>antibiotics/bacteriophage/opsonization</mark> by means of mechanical isolation (hides microbe-associated molecular patterns). They differ such that the capsule is retained by the bacterium verusus the slime layer is secreted by the bacterium, and that the slime layer is <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">more</span> hydrated.
    * S-layer <mark>may protect the cel I againstlon and pH fluctuations, osmotic stress, enzymes, or the predacious bacterium Bdellovibrio. The S-layer also helps maintain the shape and envelope ri gi dity of some cel Is. 1 1 can promote cel I adhesi on to surfaces. Finally, the S-layer seems to protect some bacterial pathogens against host defenses, thus contributing to their virulence</mark> **WIP**
* Bacteria secretes exopolysaccharides to orgnise into <mark>biofilm</mark>.
    * The biofilm can be made out of three types of polysaccharides: pel, psl and alginate. These result in different colony morphologies; psl gives a <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">wrinkled</span> morphology, and pel is a major constituant of <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">air-liquid boundary</span> biofilms. Psl presents a <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">fabric-like</span>  texture under microscope, pel presents a <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">scaffold-like</span> texture under microscope, and alginate presents a <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">loose</span> texture under microscope.
* Prokaryotic cells may present <mark>fibreae and pili</mark>
    * Fibreae are not necerssarily hollow, they are numerous, topped with <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">adhesins</span> that recognise and attach to host and are major virulance factors in serum ()[ISM Infection and Immunity Article: Role of YadA, Ail, and Lipopolysaccharide in Serum Resistance of Yersinia enterocolitica Serotype O:3](https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.73.4.2232-2244.2005)); pili exist <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">alone or in pairs</span> on the cell and are hollow, they are usually present on Gram- bacteria. Type IV pili plays an especially important role in virulance as it upregulates more than 100 virulance associated genes and is able to extend and contract as a grappling hook and scavange DNA. Studies suggest <mark>esculetin</mark> acts as an inhibitor to type IV pili. **WIP**
