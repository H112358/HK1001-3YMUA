## Material translocation **WIP**
### 1. Small molecules across membrane
* Simple diffusion - Small, uncharged/nonpolar
    * Facilitated diffusion - Small, charged/polar
        * Permeases (e.g. aquaporins. glycerol uptake facilitator)
        
### 2. Large molecules across membrane
* Secretion [classes of secretion systems](fig1)
    * SecA/SRP pathway 
        * Located on cell membrane, recognises 15-20 residues signal peptide sequence at the terminus of target peptide (signal sequence also prevents folding). SecA <mark>releases </mark>exported polypeptide, SRP <mark>embeds </mark>polypeptide in cell membrane. ... **WIP**
    * Twin-arginine translocation <mark>(Tat) pathway</mark>
        * Tat protein is comprised of A, [B, C] subunits. <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">TatBC</span> is responsible for pattern recognition. Tat complex translocate folded proteins, allowing proteins to obtain their metallic cofactors before exporting ... **WIP** [Nat.Rev in microbiology: The twin-arginine translocation (Tat)
