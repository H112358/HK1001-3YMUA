* Different trees for different loci - why?
    * Independent assortment of chromosomes?
    * Ancestral polymorphism?
    * Time of fixation of mutations relative to speciation is lost in present information
        * This plus ancestral polymorphism - chance for more distant relatives to carries same allele - discordance of gene tree to phylogeny
        * If fixation due to chance (drift) - scenario of accordance and discordance equal
        * Look at faster molecular clocks - more data - better genome matching
* Detect Gene flow
    * Intergression - flow of genetic information across species/subspecies - hybrdzation
    * Admixture - gene flow between two or more genetically distinguishable populations
    * Event of Neanderthals
        * Minority of loci show closer african sapiens - neanderthals
            * Violates hypothesis fixation is due to chance
            * Gene flow
        * ABBA-BABA test
            * Determination of gene flow
            * A(outgroup1)B(Species1)B(species1)A(outgroup2)
            * BABA - ABBA should have similar frequency if drift is main driving force
            * High ABBA = gene flow, can quantify
        * Neandethral alleles is decreasing in freaquency - deleterious
            * More bottlenecks in N populations than S populations
            * High deleterious load
* Recessive disorders
    * Selective forces works less
    * Especially following bottlenecks - low freq deleterious alleles becomes high in freq
        * E.g. Ashkenazi - Sachs disease
* Dominant disorders
    * May be less deleterious in early stages of life - not impact fertility hence fitness
    * Can be newly generated
        * Two individuals with same pathology buried together shows two different missense vs truncating mutations on two different loci - lightning can strike twice
    * On average 75 mutations vs parents
        * Women - long period of stasis
        * Sperm genesis - 23 divisions per year for each cell
            * Higher chance for autism in older fathers
* Complex disease - many alleles induce risk
    * Many low risk alleles
    * High risk alleles are mostly de novo
