* Schleiden concludes that this organ is universal and elementary, called the *cytoblast*
* Schleiden notice that size of the cytoblast varies across plant species and tissue types, that they form and diminish, he tested the firmness of the organ and concluded that it is most firm during the vital process of the plant as a permanent tissue from his observation on the Orchidae
