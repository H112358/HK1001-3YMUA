# Electron transport chain

* Fe/S cluster -> O as the redox grad. (primitive oceans may feature H2 -> CO2)
* Cytochrome C / ubiquinone (CoQ$_{10}$) -> portable glyceredox centre - fat soluble
* Oxidoreductases are named after the species which they oxidise | reduce 
* EC Classification System
Enzymes are categorized into 6 major classes by the International Enzyme Commission (EC):

    EC 1: Oxidoreductases
    Catalyze redox reactions (e.g., dehydrogenases, oxidases, reductases).
    EC 2: Transferases
    Transfer functional groups (e.g., methyltransferases, kinases).
    EC 3: Hydrolases
    Break bonds via hydrolysis (e.g., amylases, proteases).
    EC 4: Lyases
    Cleave bonds without hydrolysis (e.g., decarboxylases).
    EC 5: Isomerases
    Catalyze isomerization (e.g., racemases, epimerases).
    EC 6: Ligases
    Join molecules with ATP energy (e.g., synthetases).
