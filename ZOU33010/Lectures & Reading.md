    * Aims to describe, explain and predict
* Why is ecology important?
    * Barriers to human sustainability are mostly ecological,  e.g. massive spike in $\Delta$CO2 in the past 300 years





## Lecture 1 Reading

* Simple rules yield complex food webs

  Attempts to fit explanatory model to food web empiricals

  * S$\times$S matrix where element $a_{ij}$=1 if species i is consumed by species j and 0 otherwise. Therefore there are $S^2$ possible 1's but empirically there are $L \le S^2$ 1's since species may not be in direct trophic connection. $C=\frac{L}{S^2}$ measures directed connectance (*the proportion of documented directed links out of maximum possible directed links ... Cannibalism is an important aspect ... Accordingly I use the following algorithm*, Martinez 1991, Ecological Society of America)
