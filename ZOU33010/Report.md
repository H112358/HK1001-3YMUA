## Promoting Biodiversity in Irish Forestry: management policies and challenges

### Ireland has climate conditions ideal for temperate forests...

Ireland currently has 11% of its landmass covered by forest \cite{FoodMarineA2023}, this is much lower than the EU average at 39% \cite{}, and a significant contrast to the 80% potential cover defined by fundamental niches of tree species \cite{Cross1998}. Historically, pollen records had shown that Irish forests probably reached their post-glacial maxima before the onset of the Irish neolithic circa 6200 cal BP, before slash-and-burn farming and grazing caused early succession flora to replace woodland as the major flora in Ireland during the Irish Bronze Age. Later on, an almost complete removal of woodland from the Irish landscape was quickly reached following 1750 to feed surging food demand, correlated to the introduction of the potato crop, creating an open landscape only interspaced with exotic plantations afforested by English landlords around their estates. \cite{Mitchell1997} This landscape regime also led to pollen evidence of a loss of regional diversity in arboreal communities inhabiting variable habitat types in Ireland, and of the formation of a homogenous landscape across the island, inhabiting both acidic peats on the atlantic coast, waterlogged gleys in the midlands and brown earth in the southeast. A landscape which lasted to the present day. \cite{Cross1998} \cite{Cole2001} Although the Republic saw state afforestation programs which led to a ma*P. sitchensis*jor increase in 340000 hectares of woodland, most afforestation during the 20th century was of conifer high forest on open ground, or uplands deemed unsuitable for agricultural cultivation \cite{woodlandsurvey coillete}. The forested Irish landscape today is still dominated by high conifer woodland, primarily plantation silviculture of Sitka spruce, *Picea sitchensis*, whereas EEA-defined high natural value forests, mostly native or semi-natural woodland, cover only 1% of total land area in the Republic. \cite{Ruas2024}

* Write about the geological history of vegetation in Ireland (Ice age earth, probably citing a few articles from encyc quat sci)
* Write about the topological and hydrological conditions of Ireland
* Write about fundamental niches of tree species and how they fit in

### Current state of Irish forest cover is a highly fragmented and non-native one...

\textit{P. sitchensis} plantations are favored by the Irish forestry industry for their high lumber output under adverse site conditions in the uplands \cite{foresters association} \cite{Stokes2022}.<span style="color: red;"> Site condition in \textit{P. sitchensis} monoculture is typically defined by silvicultural practitioners according to a height-age index, which is well correlated to biomass yield in clearfalling rotations \cite{Lekwadi2012}. One clearfalling rotation is defined by a process of reforestation, thinning, and clearfalling; during afforestation, a site would be prepared by cutting and mounding the soil and by application of fertilisers and control of early-successional vegetation. Treelings of \textit{P. sitchensis} harvested from tree nursaries are then treated with insecticide and transported to the prepared site to be planted. After planting, intensive site management would be required to minimize the impact of competition, herbivory and disease on the young trees for the first 3 years \cite{FARM FORESTRY SERIES NO. 20}, {Define thinning and Clearfalling}<span style="color: red;">WIP</span>alterations in hydrology and lighting regimes, including elevated surface mean drainage and thereby increased leaching of soil ligands into freshwater ecosystems, especially during thinning operations.
