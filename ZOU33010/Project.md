[Life cycle assessment of sitka spruce forest products grown in Ireland](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-023-02222-5#data-availability)

Irish roundwood production is increasing and demand is monotonic

- sawmill and boardmill industries accounting for 64% and 31% of realised demand, out of 4.33E6 m$^3$ production
- milling industry is in oligopoly
Defined system boundary of typical Irish Sitka Spruce forestry

[Scenario analyses for the effects of harvesting intensity on development of forest resources, timber supply, carbon balance and biodiversity of Finnish forestry](https://www-sciencedirect-com.elib.tcd.ie/science/article/pii/S1389934116303823?via%3Dihub#bb0085)
Heinonen 2017 - Scenario analyses for the effects of harvesting intensity on development of forest resources, timber supply, carbon balance and biodiversity of Finnish forestry


Discusses implications of cutting targets on forestry in ireland

This study uses area of old mature forest and volume of dead wood as proxies for biodiversity
