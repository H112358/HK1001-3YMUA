## Promoting Biodiversity in Irish Forestry: management policies and challenges

### Ireland has climate conditions ideal for temperate forests...

Ireland currently has 11\% of its landmass covered by forest \cite{FoodMarineA2023}, this is much lower than the EU average at 39\% \cite{Eurostat}, and a significant contrast to the 80\% potential cover defined by fundamental niches of tree species \cite{Cross1998}. Historically, pollen records had shown that Irish forests probably reached their post-glacial maxima before the onset of the Irish neolithic circa 6200 cal BP, before slash-and-burn farming and grazing caused early succession flora to replace woodland as the major flora in Ireland during the Irish Bronze Age. Later on, an almost complete removal of woodland from the Irish landscape was quickly reached following 1750 to feed surging food demand, correlated to the introduction of the potato crop, creating an open landscape only interspaced with exotic plantations afforested by English landlords around their estates. \cite{Mitchell1997} This landscape regime also led to pollen evidence of a loss of regional diversity in arboreal communities inhabiting variable habitat types in Ireland, and of the formation of a homogeneous landscape across the island, inhabiting both acidic peat on the Atlantic coast, waterlogged gley in the midlands and brown earth in the southeast, which, without anthropogenic interference, supports different types of floral species composition. \cite{Cross1998} \cite{Cole2001} This homogeneous landscape had survived to the present day. Although the Republic saw state afforestation programs which led to a major increase in 340000 hectares of woodland, most afforestation during the 20th century was of conifer high forest on open ground, or uplands deemed unsuitable for agricultural cultivation \cite{woodlandsurvey coillete}. The forested Irish landscape today is still dominated by high conifer woodland, primarily plantation silviculture of Sitka spruce, \textit{Picea sitchensis}, whereas EEA-defined high natural value forests, mostly native or semi-natural woodland, cover only 1\% of total land area in the Republic. \cite{Ruas2024} <span style="color: red;">WIP</span> {Briefly explain the goals of the essay}

### Current state of Irish forest cover is a highly fragmented and non-native one...

\textit{P. sitchensis} is the largest species in the genus \textit{Picea}. It is native to the North American east coast, in ecological zones defined by a strong oceanic influence. It is well adapted to fog-covered landscapes with moist, phosphorous-rich soil. It is a species that does not deform under exposure \cite{Savill2013}, a phenotype which attained it much favour of the Irish forestry industry for its high lumber output under exposed site conditions in the uplands \cite{foresters association} \cite{Stokes2022}. Site characterization in \textit{P. sitchensis} monoculture has historically been yield-oriented, typically defined by silvicultural practitioners according to a height-age index, which is well correlated to biomass yield in clearfalling rotations \cite{Lekwadi2012}. One clearfalling rotation in ireland lasts typically 35-45 years and is defined by a process of reforestation, thinning, and clearfalling; during afforestation, a site would be prepared by cutting and mounding the soil and by application of fertilisers and control of early-successional vegetation, such as \textit{Calluna vulgaris}, which outcompetes young \textit{P. sitchensis} for nitrogen. Treelings of \textit{P. sitchensis} harvested from tree nursaries are then treated with insecticide and transported to the prepared site to be planted. After planting, intensive site management would be required to minimize the impact of competition, herbivory and disease on the young trees for the first 3 years \cite{FARM FORESTRY SERIES NO. 20}, for longer rotations of >50 years, it is also possible to reforest via natural regeneration due to a high proportion of \textit{P. sitchensis} in the underground seed bank. {Define thinning and Clearfalling}<span style="color: red;">WIP</span>alterations in hydrology and lighting regimes, including elevated surface mean drainage and thereby increased leaching of soil ligands into freshwater ecosystems, especially during thinning operations. \cite{}

Irish vegetation is strongly shaped by human influence
Ireland currently has 11% of its landmass covered by forest (Department of Agriculture, 2023),
this is much lower than the EU average at 39% (Eurostat, 2024), and a significant contrast to
the 80% potential cover defined by fundamental niches of forest assemblages in Ireland (Cross,
1998). Pollen records had shown that Irish forests probably reached their post-glacial maxima
before the onset of the Irish neolithic circa 6200 cal BP, subsequent decrease in tree pollen and
increase in charcoal indicated a slash-and-burn, farming and grazing induced transition to early
succession flora in the majority of Ireland, most notably during the Irish Bronze Age. Landscape
in Ireland generally became more open as human population increased, this corelation can be
further reinforced with observation of two reversals in the reduction in tree pollen correlated to
reduced human activity from climate fluctuations (Mitchell and Ryan, 1997; Cole and Mitchell,
2003).
The most decisive event to native woodlands of Ireland was induced by the introduction of
American crops. An almost complete removal of woodland from the Irish landscape was quickly
reached following 1750 as agriculture was greatly intensified to feed surging food demand of
an exponentially increasing population, correlated to the introduction of the potato crop. This
lead to a surge in charcoal as an open landscape emerged to facilitate extensive potato cultiva￾tion, only interspersed with exotic plantations,notably conifers, afforested by English landlords
around their estates (Mitchell and Ryan, 1997). This landscape regime also led to pollen ev￾idence of a loss of regional diversity in forest assemblages inhabiting variable habitat types
in Ireland, and of the formation of a homogeneous landscape across the island, incorporat￾ing both acidic peat on the Atlantic coast, waterlogged gley in the midlands and brown earth
in the southeast, which, without anthropogenic interference, supports different types of floral
assemblage (Cross, 1998; Cole and Mitchell, 2003).
This homogeneous landscape had survived to the present day. Although the Republic saw
state afforestation programs which led to a major increase in 340000 hectares of woodland, a
2004 survey on composition of woodlands on the Coillete estates concluded most afforesta￾tion during the 20th century to be of conifer high forest on open ground, or uplands deemed
unsuitable for agricultural cultivation (O’sullivan, 2004). The forested Irish landscape today is
still dominated by high conifer woodland, primarily plantation silviculture of Sitka spruce, Picea
sitchensis; the Irish forest inventory survey in 2022 reported approximately 70% of the national
woodland cover to be plantations of conifers, mostly P. sitchensis, which represent more than
40% cover area under all ownership brackets, except in older, self-established private estates
and naturally regenerated forests (Ireland’s National Forest Inventory 2022 – Results, n.d.). A
2024 survey of Irish woodland also reported that EEA-defined high natural value forests, mostly
native or semi-natural woodland, cover only 1% of total land area in the Republic (Ruas, 2024).
It could therefore be synthesized, from studies of sedimentary archives and from survey
of standing forests, that the current vegetation landscape of Ireland is anthropogenic and that
there is a substantial deficit in native woodlands in the Irish landscape. This anthropogenic
landscape is primarily shaped for productive reasons, primarily food production since 1750,
1
and increasingly, woody biomass production in the 20th century.
Picea sitchensis silviculture in Ireland is characterized by clearfelling rotations
P. sitchensis is the largest species in the genus Picea. It is native to the North American east
coast, in ecological zones defined by a strong oceanic influence, showing highest fitness on
fog-covered landscapes with moist, phosphorous-rich soil (Savill, 2013; Sitka spruce - Province
of British Columbia, n.d.). It is a species that does not deform under exposure (Savill, 2013), a
phenotype which attained it favour of the Irish forestry industry for its high lumber output under
exposed site conditions in the uplands, capable of reaching an average long term lumber yield of
14 m3ha−1 per year (Policy on diversification of species, n.d.; Stokes et al., 2023; Moore, 2011).
Site characterization in P. sitchensis monoculture has historically been yield-oriented, typically
defined by silvicultural practitioners according to a height-age index, which is well correlated to
biomass yield in clearfelling rotations; the characteristic mode of lumber production in Ireland.
(Lekwadi et al., 2012; Dolan et al., 2024).
One clearfelling rotation in Ireland lasts typically 35-45 years and is defined by a process
of afforestation, thinning, and clearfelling. According to an life cycle analysis of Irish woodland
products by Dolan et al. (2024), the typical chronosequence of the Irish P. sitchensis plantation
is defined by planting and maintenance between afforestation stage between years 0-15, one or
multiple thinning during pole stage between years 20-35, and clearfelling around years 38-41.
(Felling and reforestation standards, n.d.).
During afforestation, a site would be prepared for optimal growth of young treelings of the
tree-crop. This stage often requires that indigenous vegetation assemblages; particularly early
succession vegetation such as Calluna vulgaris, which competitively excludes young P. sitchen￾sis primarily due to being limited less by nitrogen; to be cleared from the site. The soil would
be prepared by cutting and mounding, and by application of fertilisers. Treelings of P. sitchen￾sis harvested from tree nursaries are then treated with insecticide before transported to the
prepared site to be planted. After planting, intensive site management would be required to
minimize the impact of interspecies competition, herbivory and disease on the young trees for
the first 3 years (Savill, 2013; Felling and reforestation standards, n.d.). For sites previously
planted for long rotations of >50 years, it is also possible to reforest via natural regeneration due
to a high proportion of P. sitchensis in the underground seed bank. Such longer rotations are
not the standard practice in Ireland, as the shorter financial rotation, which maximises returns
to the grower, is preferred in Ireland (Duffy et al., 2020; Ford and Deans, 1978).
Thinning and Clearfelling employs similar methods and materials. They differentiate in that
clearfelling harvests the entire stand of tree-crop, whilst thinning removed part of the tree-crop.
(Felling and reforestation standards, n.d.) Thinning is typically conducted during pole stage
starting from year 20, primarily to reduce root and shoot competition between developing crop￾plants and improve timber grade by promoting more biomass growth per plant. The two main
types of thinning practiced in Ireland are rack and selection thinning, differentiated by whether
tree lines are methodologically removed, such as in rack thinning, usually by every seventh
line (Hale, 2003; Phillips, 2004; Hale et al., 2004). Clearfelling is conducted at the end of the
clearfelling cycle, when the stock of tree-crop is harvested for biomass. The legal maximum
2
area of clearfell in Ireland is 25ha, and adjoining stands can only be clearfelled 12 months after
completion of the first clearfell (Felling and reforestation standards, n.d.). Both thinning and
clearfelling requires transportation of machinery to and from the site, and product material from
the site, forest roads are usually constructed on demand to facilitate this. Machinery typically
involved in tree felling of Picea sitchensis includes Specialised forwarding machines on tractor
systems, which optimally performs when extracting 9-12 tonnes of biomass across a run of
250-300 metres (Teagasc, 2024).
Clearfelling forestry negatively influence biodiversity
Clearfelling forestry supports very low levels of biodiversity. Closed canopy plantations of high
conifers such as P. sitchensis show reduced incident light in the understory and increased soil
moisture deficiency (Ford and Deans, 1978; Hale, 2003), which leads to podzolisation resultant from weathering of mineral nitrates from the soil (Nielsen et al., 1999). Hence, monoculture
plantations of S. sitchensis support low understory biomass and diversity, by limitation to exclusion of many understory species through limiting light throughfall and soil nitrogen. This
further reduces carrying capacity for consumers; according to a review by O’Callaghan (2017),
plantation woodlands of S. sitchensis show lower species richness of bryophytes and vascular
plants, particularly in the understory, which is important
