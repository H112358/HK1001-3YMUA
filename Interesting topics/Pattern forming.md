# Pattern forming

Retinoic acid opposes FGF to form gradient across apical/p axis and also contributes to formation of Hox code in prim streak

Dose dependent e.g. zone of polarizing activity transplantation forms mirror polydactyly
* Determined cell fate?
Actually, if some of the cells are transplanted, a weaker mirror polydactyly but no wrong morphology
Shh beads reproduce the same effect
extra-toes ad ssq mutants in mice show preaxial polydactyly and increased ectopic anterior expression of Shh - mutation in control elements
Shh knockout mice show phonotype similar to human acheiropodia, with a mutation that maps to the chromosome domain where Shh is transcribed

Not simply a gradient like the french flag - both length of time the cells express and exposures to concentration of Shh as well as morph type are relavant, BMP seems to instruct cells of their morph types

Shh signalling involves internalization inactivation of membrane components that process an activator into a repressor in the primary cilium - turns on Hox genes

Colinearity along the Prox/Dist axis: Hox mediated
Shared reg element: e.g. Early Limb Control Region in limb pattern formation
Shh enhancer is switched on where coexpression of Hoxd11\12\13
Shh activates the Global Control Region 

Dorsal/Ventral patterning
Wnt7a only expressed in dorsal ectoderm

Coordination of axial signalling
Spacial differentiation in Wnt genes expression
