# Pyrmidine dimerisation and chryptochromes



# Pyrmidine dimerisation



* Occurs under UV irradiance

* Repaired by cryptochrome/photolyase proteins in bacteria
    * Critical residues missing in plant cryptochromes, instead signalling molecule. [CRYPTOCHROMES (CRYs) are structurally related to UV/blue-sensitive DNA repair enzymes called photolyases but lack their ability to repair pyrimidine dimers generated by UV exposure.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7328257/) [It is very similar to that of photolyase except it lacks the positively charged DNA binding groove (42) and has an unstructured C-terminal extension beyond the photolyase homology region.](https://doi-org.elib.tcd.ie/10.1074/jbc.R800052200)
