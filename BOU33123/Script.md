There is a continuous accumulation of sediment at this site at inconsisntant rate, such differenctiating rates can be ascribed to transition between marine and terrestrial deposition environments. Marine deposition rates are higher due to increased terrigenous sediment transport in the North Atlantic compared to terrestrial decomposition. This may also apply to the two stages of peat accumulation. An erosion surface is positioned at 315cm in the core, corresponding to a ~800 years gap between cal BP estimated at top of basal peat and bottom of silty clay. It may be worth noting that foraminefera was calibrated using the marine20 dataset, which produces the least time discrepancy between the top layer of clay and bottom layer of superficial peat. Coarse sand containing the shell fragment was transported from another benthic source that was deposited before the surface of basal peat it covered in this core.
