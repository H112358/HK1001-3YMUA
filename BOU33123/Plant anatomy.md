# Leaf anatomy

**Leaves are the primary site of photosynthesis and transpiration in the majority of terrestrial plants**. Morphology of leaves [is highly selected for effective photosynthesis](https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.110.165472), evolution of leaves [arose from multiple evolutionary events during the Devonian, while concerning the same KNOX/ARP module](https://langdalelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evolving-pathways.pdf); they are therefore important proxies of taxonomy in paleobotany. **Leaves perform two major physiologies: that of photosynthesis and that of transpiration**. Leaves present in the [sporophyte](../BOU33123/Plant%20life%20cycle.md##sporophytic%20stage) stage of vascular plants contains two layers of mesophyll: spongy parenchyma and palisade parenchyma. Palisade parenchyma is located at the apoxial end of the mesophyll, and typically has cell morphologies exihibiting compact cells with more chloroplast; spongy parenchyma has cell morphologies exibiting loosely spaced cells with intercellular air spaces. Development of the morphologies are controlled by light condition; [palisade parenchyma is promoted by blue light](https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.111.085852) and in some plants is [inhibited by shading](https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.19.00275). Mechanistically, the photoreceptor responsible for blue light sensing is <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;"> phototropin 2</span> and shading is sensed by <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">phytochromes A and B</span>. **CO2 influx is limited by conductance across three boundaries**; namely the air space - mesophyll boundary, the stomatal boundary and the boundary layer - environment boundary. *<mark>Notice the notion of the boundary layer here, its resistance is derived in section 3 of [this](https://edepot.wur.nl/166537) paper, I am interested in whether there is a meaningful way to calculate the thickness of said layer, or the notion of a boundary layer could be mere modelling conveniance.</mark>*. **Leaves are also major storage organs**. <span style="color: red;">WIP</span>
