Reading: Chalmers, Alan. 2013. What is this thing called science? 4th ed. pp. 1–4
- Science is not necessarily derived from the facts
    - What does this statement tell about the author's position?
    - "facts" here are <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">direct subjective observations of the world</span>.
    - "derive" here is the act of <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">sound reasoning</span>.
    - <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">the author opposes scientific realism(?)</span>.
    

H.D.Anthony is an opponent to the hitherto statement. In his book on the scientific method, he stated that:
"It was not so much the observations and experiments which Galileo made that cause the break with tradition as his attitude to them. For him, the facts based on them were taken as facts, and not related to some <mark>preconveived idea</mark> ... <mark>The facts of observation</mark> might, or might not, fit into an acknowledged scheme of the universe, but the important thing, in Galileo's opinion, was to accept the facts and build theory to fit them"; 

or tldr: <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">The scientific method is historically extrodinary because it for the first time takes facts, through observation, as the basis of theory</span>.

This idea was formalised by empiricists and positivists.
- empiricists: Locke, Berkeley and Hume. All knowlege should be derived from ideas implanted in the mind by means of <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">sense perception</span>.
- positivists : 
    - logical positivists: focus on the logical form how knowledge has with facts

What is "fact"? how do we arrive at them?
Are laws and theories derived from "fact"? 

To the above questioning, the empiricist or the positivist may formulate the following:
(a)Facts are directly given to careful, unprejudiced observers via<span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;"> the senses</span>
.
(b) Facts are prior to and independent of <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">theory</span>
.
(c) Facts constitute a firm and reliable foundation for scientific <span style="color: transparent; background-color: black;">knowledge</span>
.

> A knowledge of the historic and philosophical background gives that kind of independence from prejudices of his generation from which mostr scientists are suffering. This indipendence created by philosophicl insight is - in my opinion - the mark of distinction between a mere artisan or specialist and a real seeker of truth. -A. Einstein

* Induction is the act of summarizing empirically a sufficient large amount of observations and assume they will hold for the future
