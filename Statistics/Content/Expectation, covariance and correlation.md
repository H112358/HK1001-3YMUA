## !==Pearson's linear correlation==!

- ### Formula

  Pearson's linear correlation measures the correlation between two classes of data, it is applicable only to data distributed in normal form, correlation is measured from -1 to 1. the formula is $r= \frac {\Sigma{XY} - [(\Sigma{X}) \times (\Sigma{Y})]/n} {[\Sigma{X}-{(\Sigma{X})^2}/n \times (\Sigma{Y^2}-(\Sigma{Y})^2/n)]^{\frac {1}{2}}}$. Critical values are then compared from a critical value table, where degree of freedom = n of classes - 2
