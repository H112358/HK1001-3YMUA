There is a continuous accumulation of sediment at this site at inconsisntant rate, such differenctiating rates can be ascribed to transition between marine and terrestrial deposition environments. Marine deposition rates are higher due to increased terrigenous sediment transport in the North Atlantic compared to terrestrial decomposition. This may also apply to the two stages of peat accumulation. An erosion surface is positioned at 315cm in the core, corresponding to a ~800 years gap between cal BP estimated at top of basal peat and bottom of silty clay. It may be worth noting that foraminefera was calibrated using the marine20 dataset, which produces the least time discrepancy between the top layer of clay and bottom layer of superficial peat. Coarse sand containing the shell fragment was transported from another benthic source that was deposited before the surface of basal peat it covered in this core.

The following chronology can be constructed: a terrestrial deposition enviroment predominated the site producing this sedimentary archive, there is then a potential rise in relative sea level following an abrupt high-energy transportation event, submerging the site to form shallow marine environemts, high sedimentation rate in this environment eventually lead to emergence of the site and a restoration of terrestrial environment. The discussion proposes hypothesis to two conditions outlining the above chronology: one for the cause of submergance, one for the cause of reemergance.

Hypothesis that submergance was by relative sea level rose due to meltwater pulse is nonsensual. Since 1. the estimated time at which the abrupt transportation event took place does not align with record of meltwater pulses in the North Atlantic; 2. it is unreasonable that a meltwater event would transport benthic sediment to the shore. Assuming uniform deposition rate and disregarding compaction, ~40cm of basal peat was removed by the abrupt transportation event. The abruptness and high energy profile of this event aligns it close to a tsunami. Therefore, is it likely that relative sea level change here is caused primarily by vertical land motion due to subsidence of  tectonic plate? Again this is unlikely, since Newfoundland is not located near subduction plate boundaries. It is likely, however, that glaciastatic adjustment operates in this rise in relative sea level, since Newfoundland is located in the periphery of the area of decompression caused by the North American ice sheet and is experiencing rising relative sea level as a result of glacioisostatic adjustment. Submergance can therefore be explained by glacioisostatic adjustment in conjunction to surface erosion by a tsunami-like event. What about reemergance? Since there is a transition from marine to intertidal to terrestrial characteristics in the sedimentary archive, it is feasible to hypothesize that it is sedimentation that lead to reemergance, this also aligns with the high sedimentation rate seen for the clay section of the core. It then begs the question why this high rate of deposition? considering increased rates of deposition in reemerged peat than basal peat, it may be suggested that a new source of sediments or new sediment transportation had been introduced by the time of reemergance. The discussion hypothesize it to be a change in inland hydrography that lead to alluvial feeding of sedimentary material to the site, which may also account for the high rate of deposition in the submerged section of this chronology.

Therefore the chronology can be formulated as such: a tsunami-like event took place approximately 1600 calendar years BP, eroding and submerging parts of the coastline. Inland hydrographical changes then lead to high deposition of sediments at this eroded section of the coastline before it reemerged approximately 850 calendar years BP. After emergance, alluvial sediments continue to deposit on the emerged saltmarsh, leading to higher rates of deposition to the present day.

Google Gemini 2.5flash on Oct 31 2025 was prompted with "summarize in 250 words [content of above discussion]" and outputted as such: 

The site shows inconsistent sediment accumulation rates linked to transitions between marine and terrestrial depositional environments. Higher rates occurred during marine phases, likely due to increased terrigenous sediment transport. A significant erosion surface at 315cm represents an ∼800-year gap (cal BP) between the basal peat and the overlying silty clay. Foraminifera and a shell fragment in coarse sand was calibrated on the Marine20 dataset. A deviation of the principle of superposition by the broken shell sample suggests the transport of older benthic material.

The constructed chronology starts with a terrestrial environment, followed by an abrupt, high-energy transportation event that caused submergence and the formation of a shallow marine environment. High sedimentation then led to re-emergence and a return to terrestrial conditions.

The hypothesis that a meltwater pulse caused submergence is dismissed due to timing and the unlikelihood of a meltwater event transporting benthic sediment. The abruptness and high-energy profile of the event aligns it with a tsunami, which is estimated to have occurred around 1600 cal BP, eroding ∼40cm of basal peat. The primary cause of relative sea level rise and submergence is attributed to glacioisostatic adjustment, as Newfoundland is in the periphery of the North American ice sheet's decompression area.

Re-emergence, completed by ∼850 cal BP, is hypothesized to be due to high sedimentation rates in the marine phase. This high deposition is further hypothesized to result from a change in inland hydrography, which introduced a new alluvial sediment source to the site. This new source may also account for the continued higher rate of deposition in the post-emergence peat to the present day.

Introduction
Members of the Photolyase/Cryptochrome Family play vastly different roles across different do￾mains of life utilizing the same blue light sensitive domain, including bacterial DNA repair and
plant photomorphogenesis. This desktop study aims to explore the extent of current knowl￾edge on the molecular biology of this protein family, highlight the role in plant physiology of its
members, and discuss its applications in optogenetic manipulation.
It’s a long way from resurrection: current understanding of the PCF
family
A highly conserved family of flavoproteins had been discovered to contain the Photolyase Ho￾mology Region, including photolyases and cryptochromes. CPD-photolyase, which catalyses
photoreactivation utilising energy from UV radiation to repair DNA damage from UV irradiance,
is identified as the functional prototype of this protein family (DeOliveira and Crane, 2024). The
last common ancestor of most modern taxa probably existed under heavy UV radiation; since a
class of flavoproteins, CPD-photolyase, which is ubiquitously found in all domains of cellular life
except placental mammals, repairs DNA damage from cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD)
(Sagan, 1973). CPD is the product of thymine or cytosine dimerisation, which are four-electron,
[2+2] cycloaddition reactions between adjacent C=C bonds that are usually stereochemically
prohibited by the Woodward–Hoffmann rules, unless orbital stereochemistry is altered via inci￾dence of electromagnetic radiation (Grossman, 2019), which was abundant on the early earth
surface due to the lack of an ozone layer(Walker, 1978). This early evolutionary pressure may
underpin the early evolution of CPD-photolyase, which undergoes fast blue-light-induced re￾pair of CPDs on target DNA. This is a highly potent enzyme. To illustrate, CPD-photolyase
was initially reported in Streptomyces griseus (Kelner, 1949), where it was identified as the
protein responsible for light-induced resurrection of UV-killed cells. Key to the repair func￾tion of CPD-photolyase are two proposed mechanisms; the photoreduction of a flavin adeno￾sine dinucleotide (FAD) and an electron-transfer-mediated, stepwise cleavage of the two C-C
bonds formed during [2+2] cycloaddition between the pyrimidines. Structural adaptations of
CPD-photolyase have been highlighted: a highly conserved three-tryptophan electron transfer
chain, elucidated from protein BLAST alignment and evolutionary trace studies, is proposed to
be responsible for photoreduction of the photoactivated FAD*, forming a highly reactive FADH·
radical(MacFarlane and Stanley, 2001; Londero et al., 2025); the other is a DNA binding groove
that selectively binds to CPD photolesions (Mees et al., 2004). Course of the repair mechanism
had been elucidated by femtosecond crystallography using x-ray free electron lasers (Maestre￾Reyna et al., 2023; Christou et al., 2023). However, due to light incidence from laser source
during crystallography being far above physiological levels, the exact repair mechanism under
physiological conditions remains contentious (Vos, 2023).
CPD-photolyase homologs, known as cryptochromes (CRYs), are eukaryotic proteins con￾taining a long N-terminal domain homologous to CPD-photolyase, and are blue-light sensing
proteins responsible for an array of functions in multicellular life, notably photomorphogenesis
in plants. Cryptochrome was first identified by its absence in the hy4 mutant in Arabidopsis
1
thaliana, which exhibits selective insensitivity to blue light during the blue-light-dependent inhi￾bition of the hypocotyl elongation response during seed germination (Ahmad and Cashmore,
1993). Structurally, CRYs share with CPD photolyase the ability to reduce a FAD cofactor upon
photoactivation, but had lost the binding affinity to CPD photolesions. It was initially understood
that the homologous domain to photolyase DNA binding groove in CRYs are lost or closed, as
evidence suggest specificity to CPD photolesions is much lower in CRYs than in photolyase
(Sato et al., 2018), however more recent research underpinned a model of blue-light-induced
steric hindrance removal by a section the variable C-terminal coupled motif (CCM) in CRYs, in
Drosophila melanogaster, that allows access to a mutated binding groove specific to a protein
motif (Lin et al., 2023). Nevertheless, CRYs do not bind to most of their signalling partners;
such as morphogetic regulators COP1 of seed germination (Han et al., 2020) and CIB1 of flow￾ering initiation (Liu et al., 2018) in plants; constitutively as monomers. Instead, photoexcited
plant CRYs transiently assemble into homodimers via an interaction surface exposed by con￾formational changes in response to FAD reduction, which plays a key role in their interaction
with signalling partners. It had been reported that mutant CRYs that auto-dimerize without pho￾toactivation are constitutively active, and that the CRY inhibitor BIC1 blocks CRY dimerization
(Shao et al., 2020).
Like seeds of a pomegranate: photophysiology of CRYs in Ara￾bidopsis and their optogenetic application
Plant CRYs, for example in A. thaliana, acts in two physically different mechanisms. Upon pho￾toactivation and homodimerization, CRYs are found to undergo phosphorylation on their CCM
domain by photoregulatory protein kinases (Liu et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2022), which further
activates CRYs and promote the exposure of a second interaction surface that allows aggre￾gation of CRY-CRY homodimers into homotetramers. Homotetramers are capable, through
an unelucidated mechanism, condense further into photobodies. The photobody is defined as
the nuclear body/domain consisting of photoexcited photoreceptor, such as CRYs, and their
interacting proteins in plants (Lyu et al., 2021). Photobodies demonstrate liquid–liquid phase
separation (LLPS). Upon blue-light activation, CRY2 tetramers nucleate the formation of hy￾percondensed protein droplets in the nucleus, within which both constitutive CRY-interacting
proteins and non-constitutive CRY signalling partnets accumulate, within seconds of illumina￾tion. Condensates remain in the liquid phase due to the disorganised structure of CCM do￾mains post-phosphorylation; without phosphorylation of the CCM orbit, CRY2 forms immobile
aggregates with diminished physiological activity. LLPS-driven enrichment of CRY complexes
increases kinetic rates of interactions between CRYs and diverse signalling proteins, including
enzymes and transcription factors. This regime allows rapid and spatially organized modulation
of gene expression in the Arabidopsis plant (Wang and Lin, 2025).
Studies on photo-dimerization and oligomerization had led to the development of several
optogenetic tools, the most popular being the CRY2-CIB1 switch (Kennedy et al., 2010). This
molecular switch utilises non-constitutive affinity between A. thaliana CRY2 and CIB1, whereby
photoactivated CRY2 homodimers quickly binds to CIB1 ... CRY1-GL2 complexing in Zeas
mays competitively inhibits formation of CER6-GL2 enzyme complex and thus inhibits cuticular

wax biosynthesis. Possible to engineer into negative switch? (Liu et al., 2025)
Discussion
This desktop study took a wide browse of the current scope of knowledge on the structure and
function of two classes of proteins in the PCF family, CPD-photolyase and CRY2, the latter
being the primary blue light receptor in plants. It attempted to identify key research output
that led to the formation of this current understanding; and prime obstacles impeding current
research.
