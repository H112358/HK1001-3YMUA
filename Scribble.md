1. Fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation (betaoxidation) are not simple reversals of each other. compare and contrast the features of the pathways of betaoxidation and fatty acid synthesis

- Fatty acid synth
    - step 1: acetyl group is exported from the mitochondrion
        - There are no transporters for NADH, AcoA or oxaloacetate
            - There are: Phosphate (driven by $\Delta$pH), Pyruvate ($\Delta$pH) Adenine nucleotide ($\Delta \psi$), Glutamate/aspartate ($\Delta \mu _H ^+$), Dicarboxylate (electroneutral), Tricarboxylate (electroneutral) $\alpha$ - Ketoglutarate (electroneutral) and Oxaloacetate (electroneutral)
        - oxaloacetate forms citrate by adding acetyl group
            - Mitochondrial citrate carrier: generates NADPH for lipid/chlstrl biosynth   bb
        - AcoA carboxylase
            - Large ER tertiary protein enzyme synthesize Malonyl CoA from Acetyl CoA (carboxylation) consuming 1ATP
            - genes ACC1 and ACC2 regulated by alternative splicing in response to nutritional status
            - allosteric motifs for activation by citrate and inhibition by fatty acids
