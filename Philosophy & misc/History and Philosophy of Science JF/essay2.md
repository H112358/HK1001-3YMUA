The scientific revolution - Kuhn's trajectory from falisficationism and inductivism

Kuhn argues that there are two kinds of science - normal - where a research paradigm protects its participants from continuously debating theoratical basis that prevents esoteric reseach, and extrodinaty - science that bombards current paradigms with falsifying evidence and force researchers to abandon the current paradigm to adopt a new paradigm which then turns to become normal science. Kuhn also makes such a statement that a switch of paradigms is more psychological than it is to do with objective knowledge, this will be discussed later in the section on scientific realism.

covering law model of explanation

Explanans must contain empirically true (antecedent) sentences and sentences of general law; explanans must deductively entain explanandum

Causation models: Causation, causual explanation and law

CM model attribute to a causal process the property of physical continuity; that any local physical modification of the physical processes involved in the causation would be temporally transferrable across the causation process. To explain a phenomenon using this model one must therefore place the explanans temporally upstream of the explanandum and connext them via a nexus of causual processes. This model however dismisses abstractation involved in formulating explanatory language, which may omit infinitely many, spare few that gains attention, causal processes in the nexus.


Russell's three propositions:

AfBt
Laws do not mention causation
<mark>Laws relate whole systems across time instead of causes to effects</mark>
    Covering law explanation => if a sentence of the explanans connect a true condition and the explanandum, it must be a law
    Are "whole systems" objective knowledge or products of laws? They are defined by laws 
Laws are time-symmetrical

## Essay 2

This essay aims to explain Russell's second proposition to support his argument of laws and causation being distinct: that laws relate whole systems across time and causation relates individual causes to effects, and examine their relative importance to explanation.

Russell attacked the law of causality as an axiom of science [1917] by first defining causality as follows: 

> For any event, $e_1$, there is an event $e_2$ and a time interval $\tau$ such that, whenever $e_1$ occurs, $e_2$ follows after an interval $\tau$.

He then proceeded to attack the statement of science being based on causal laws. First, that causal laws must form recurrances, however since causes are events which must prima facie assume particular conditions; whereas in science, there is "an ever-widening circle of antecedents recognised as relevant". It is therefore impossible for a causal nexus of events to be both examinable to exactitude and to recur, because to assume such a level of detail in the antecedents as to formulate an exact description of such a nexus would prohibit its recurrance. Second, since there must exist a time interval between a cause and its effect due to time being compact and causality being contiguous, there is always room for interruption to occur which upsets causality. Hence, causality is at most a local phenomenon, it cannot be universal or deterministic.

Russell proposes that in advanced science laws take place in the form of functions. A function is an ordered pair that defines a deterministic mapping between the sets of an image and its pre-images (Haussdorf, 1914). Russell argues that all empirically generalized scientific knowledge eventually take form of functions in the mature sciences, where any state in the last or next instant determines the states probable of the following or previous instant. Such functions should hold uniformly true across observed physical systems in the empirical past and therefore, inductively, are expected to uniformly hold in the future and across all physical systems such as those observed. Russell claims that the only precise sense of determination is in the sense of functions, which are ipso facto deterministic, and that, since the practice of science inductively assumes uniformity of nature and admits functional laws, the universe, in empirical rather than epistemic sense, is assumed by science to be deterministic.

This essay will now attempt to tackle the comparative problem. The first question to beg is whether nomological or causal explanations is more true in a deterministic universe that Russell assumes; while it seems quite clear that Russell's 1917 thesis, which outright refutes any usage of the language of causation in describing a deterministic system and concludes only nomic accounts of scientific knowledge confer empirical truth, would decisively favour nomological explanations; it would cripple many special sciences if there are no causal truths (Cartwright, 1979). A defense for causal laws would be David Lewis' counterfactual-dependence theory [1973]. This theory rescues law-like causality by restructuring its description, such that event $e2$​ causally depends on $e1$​ if, had $e1​$ not occurred, $e2$​ would not have occurred. Yet a presumption made should this narrative remain a realist one, is that there is a set of real possible worlds; where all proposable effects of a cause resides, physically independent of each other; hence, that there are sets of modal propositions between which law-like counterfactuals can hold. Lewis defines modal propositions as set thoeretic conveniences: 

> functional operations on propositions are the appropriate Boolean operations on sets of worlds; logical relations among propositions are relations of inclusion, overlap, etc. among sets.

While this definition seems to appeal to Russell's idea of the function, it introduces the metaphysical idea of a set of multiple worlds, whose truth-bearing property needs questioning. A possible refutation to Lewis would be to present his propositions to the integration challenge (Peackoke, 1999), which asks for every metaphysical account to confer an epistemological explanation for the account to be realist. There is no definitive epistemic connection for anyone to access Lewis' modal propositions, since other "multiple worlds" prima facie cannot be spacially or temporally associated with the observer. It may be argued that knowledge of propositions are a priori knowledge, but a priori knowledge is not usually associated to empirical science, except on instances where a system of a priori knowledge enjoys continued success as a means to knowledge about empirical trucths (such as mathematics). Therefore, it is questionable whether causal relations are true.

The second question to beg is the question of practice. In comparison to functional laws, causal graphs are not epistemically unifying since they can only contain finitely numbered variables, however causal graphs does provide amibguous, bayesian probabilistic predictions to the outcome of manipulations(Sprites et al., 1993), it is quite clear that the practice of science has teleological goals, since it is carried out via the volition of researchers, and that experimental data only probabilistically verifies or rejects hypothesis. Based on this reasoning, causal accounts of explanation can be appealing if the aim of the explanation is to predict the outcome of a local manipulation, although it does not confer all the necessary truths that makes the explanation a total account of the deterministic processes involved. Can nomological expanations achieve this using probabilistic data? Maybe, but there is the issue of inductive risk involved.

To draw a conclusion, I would

(refer to manipulation theorum on practical implication, it's open in documents)
It then begs the question whether it is more relevant to cite causatalities or laws in explanation, this is most conveniently illustrated by attempting to explain without invoking either. The permitivity of a material could be deterministically determined from its electronic state in the last or following instant without leaving a temporal gap that distinguish causative events. A flaw in this explanation is that does not take into account of the state of the rest of the universe which is also deterministic, in Russellian principle, to the permitivity of this material. For example a beam of ionizing radiation may just reach our material from a violent stellar event thousands of lightyears away, or from the volition of a researcher trying to observe its influence on the material, would upset our explanation. Since the universe is deterministic the only explanation that truthfully explains any physical event is one of the whole universe, any other explanation that cites functional laws in its explanans epistemically isolate its explanandum from the rest of the universe and becomes an imaginery device. Is it then possible for an explanation that describes empirical contingencies and entails no deterministic relationship to be truthful?
 
It is possible, however, to truthfully describe a phenomenon in an explanation by citing its causation, however such explanation will lack the predictive power of science if they refuse to cite functional laws. The growth of new leaves in spring can be explained through a causative event-sequence without citing functional laws, for example the angle between the planes of apparent motion of the sun and the moon causes seasons, and that plants hibernate because winter comes and shoots at the start of spring. But such explanation will fail to predict whether a dead or chemically altered tree will shoot, or if a tree from a subarctic region will shoot in spring or hibernate in winter in a tropical region, since it merely describes empirical contingencies and entails no deterministic relationship.

To answer one must first specify the class of explanandum in ones account - whether they are events or epistemically non-local physical configurations. In Russell's terms, real events cannot be precisely explained in terms of functional laws, rather an assumption has to be made such that the physical system in which the explanandum takes place is unaffected by the state of the rest of the universe, in this sense the explanation assumes *ceteris paribus* condition and the explanandum has to be imaginery. Hence any explanation of physical events that cite functional laws are limited in their explainatory power because the explanandum ca nnot be both physical and imaginery.
