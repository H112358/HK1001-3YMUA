#  Note-keeping guidelines

[TOC]

## File management

### Save location

The note tree must be placed under the repository name "E/Core subjects".

### File types

Files can be written in .md or .tex, completed articles can be saved to .pdf to be more easily viewed, for such pdf's; whenever, in the case of a .md file, an edit is done to the .md file, or, in the case of a .tex file, a new .pdf file is compiled, the former .pdf file should be removed. In the case such removal is not undertaken immediately, refer to the changelog.

## Keys and formats

### Key

​	Keys should cover the designated language as well as any associated punctuation

#### 	WIP indications

- ==Headings===Source required
- ~~Headings~~=Review for removal

#### Emphasis

- **Bold**=Single term
- *Italics*=Concept / plural term
- <u>Underline</u>=Other information regarded as important

### Title

​	The title should always consist of three elements: **table of contents** ([TOC]), **changelog,** and **Article type**, with the order of these elements irrelevant.

#### Changelog

​	A changelog is added whenever a paragraph is increased, decreased, added, or removed, or if paragraphs are merged or split. <u>When more than one action is performed, assign them to different rows according to the order table below, and use a semicolon to conclude each action. Use a full stop to conclude an edit.</u>

| Order  |                                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Higher | Edits modifying any paragraph of more than 1000 words ($1000$, or adding more than 500 words; Edits changing section order by removing, adding or rearranging; |
| Lower  | Edits modifying any paragraph of more than 500 words and less than or 1000 words, or adding more than 50 words and less than or 500 words; Edits changing paragraph order by removing, adding or rearranging; |
| Lowest | Edits modifying any paragraph of less than or 500 words, or adding less than or 50 words; |



### 	Footnote

​	Footnotes are added When existing external sources; <u>at least 5 years old</u> or, in the case of novel research, published by [**reliable sources**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources)[^1]; are able to better and more concisely conclude a subject than could be phrased in the article.  The format is a link (where possible) + reference, reference follows MLA format. <u>Graphic information should also go in the footnotes</u>

## Article types

### Full article

​	A **full article** explores all possibilities of a "**discussible topic**"; one that is able to be referred to in index articles as a single reference. Its only and utmost restraint is its title, a full article is expected to <u>fully define and explain the subject, exclusively, of its title.</u>

### Minor (Subject/Stub) article

​	A **minor article** does not need to contain an index or follow a certain format, it must be <u>small</u>, and contains <u>no outgoing links</u>. The aim of writing a minor article is to summarise the context of a very specific topic as briefly as possible. A minor article should not exceed 700 words. <u>Minor articles may be merged into full articles or expanded into full articles</u>.

### Index article

​	An **index article** should collect articles associated with its topic, should provide brief introductions and many links to full and minor articles, it should not outsource information (contain footnotes).

## Editing

​	Always record instances under **changelog**. Think twice before you ink. When deleting any section, please use the ~~strikeout~~ format first, since you can obviously not roll back between versions
